"Jamie, welcome and thank you very much for coming here today.   Pleasure to be here, thank you, everybody. I noticed a lot of other folks here I didn't expect to be here, so welcome,",
"friends, from other places.   This is the third you've come to talk to us and I have to ask are we just very lucky to have you or is there some perhaps latent",
"regret in choosing our competitor on the east coast for your own business school?           So why, my wife went to Harvard Business School, I went to Harvard Business School,",
my daughter went to Harvard Business School and two son-in-laws went to Harvard Business School.,
But we love Stanford.    I like to come out here all the time. When I come out here I realize why you don't work so hard out here.,
"Now speaking of business school, we have many people in the room who are trying to decide between entrepreneurship",
Leaving Harvard Business School,
"and more traditional paths on leaving. Do you mind talking to the decision you made on leaving Harvard yourself, and",
if you'd do the same thing today?   So when I'd worked at a small really second rate consulting company,
"before business school, back then they had a deferred admit, so I was admitted but I had to work for two years. And I did the consulting thing,",
"you learn a lot, I also learned I didn't want to be a consultant. But I saw a whole bunch of different companies and industries, including badly",
"run political, all these various things, so it was actually a very good experience.",
"But when I got to Harvard Business School, I actually worked at Goldman-Sachs the summer of 81 and I was headed back to Goldman, Morgan, or Lehman.",
"I was probably going to decide Goldman, and at the last minute, Sandy Weill offered me a job to be his assistant. He had just sold Shearson,",
which is a brokerage firm with a couple thousand brokers through American Express. And it just looked like it was just too good to not to see a large corporation,
"from the inside, how it goes. My goal in life was to be part of an organization. It wasn't necessarily to be an investment banker or a trader or something like that.",
"So I took the crap shoot, I figured, worse comes to worst, I can go back to Wall Street. So I didn't feel like I was going to lose anything but time.",
"Yes, I would make the same decision again. Maybe not for the same guy again but the same decision.",
"Now, Samuel Weill obviously saw something in you at the time. When you meet men and women our age at JP Morgan today,",
Leadership characteristics,
"what leadership characteristics are you looking for in them ,and how do you identify and bring those people through as the next generation?",
"When you're young, it's hard to say leadership characteristics but there's just some basic stuff. There are people who know a lot.",
"There's some people walk into your office and say, I'd like to know about the strategy of the company and they didn't bother to",
"read the chairman's letter I wrote which is 30 or 40 pages long. There are people who walk in and say, you really should be thinking about doing",
"better digital services but they don't look at the ones we do do. The other people walk in and they know everything, and so",
"when they have a conversation, they're actually enhancing your life as opposed to the other way around.",
"So character is a sine qua non and by character, I also mean that they tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth.",
"They don't shave the truth and they say the same thing to you that they say to you, because the second I see people doing something different than that,",
"you just go on a list to me, I have no interest. I don't have time for that and I won't have interest in it, and",
"people who are good relate well to other people, so a variety of things.",
Competitive and collaborative leadership,
"I think when we look at finances, often people concentrate on the competitive leadership characteristics they see there.",
"At the GSB, we have a real folks on the collaborative. How do you see the balance between competitive and collaborative.   Competitive inside the company?",
"Inside and out.   I think the things that destroy companies, folks, are bureaucracy and politics.",
"We had an offsite this summer, I asking many times, we gotta make this simple,",
"we gotta make this better, we gotta kill our meetings are too long, and we stand behind regulations sometimes, the regulators are making us do it.",
"But I said no, we're going to re-imagine all these things the way they should be, not the way they are today and",
"let's take a crack at killing some of this bureaucracy that's grown up recently. And someone wrote a memo, and we all do pre-reads.",
"In my meetings, you don't flip through a chart, it's all pre-reads, I expect you to do your homework, get the analysis and part it up with people beforehand.",
"So you don't walk in and say, I want to do a, b, and c but I haven't spoken to this person yet. I would say, why didn't you speak to this person?",
The meeting is cancelled. Go do that first and then come back with a joint recommendation or that you disagree and then we'll talk about specifically why you disagree about something.,
"Anyway, I'd asked about bureaucracy and the pre-read by saying bureaucracy is a initially a condition at the output of complex businesses operating in complex global environments.",
"It's just not true, bureaucracy kills. Bureaucracy drives out good people, it drives out innovation.",
It makes the person in the office next to you a competitor and not a collaborator and that's a really bad idea inside a company.,
"Now it's okay to compete with ideas but it's really bad idea when you're competing with the person next to you. It creates politics and if you look at what's killed companies over the years,",
"it was bureaucracy. When you look at the Fortune 500 and you did a 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, look at the companies who failed,",
"it was because they were dumb, bureaucratic, backward and political.",
"CEOs should never allow that stuff and yet they do, as a normal course, they allow it and you've seen a lot of public companies and boards allow it.",
"Boards can create it, by the way. So absolute collaboration, but collaboration does not mean everyone has to agree.",
"Collaboration does not mean you go a long to get along, because that's very often what people mean by it.",
"He's a good guy, if you walk into me and say I'm going to be loyal to you, l would question what that means because you should be loyal to the institution.",
"You should be loyal to the customers, you could be loyal to the principles for which l stand, but being loyal to me usually means you're going to defend my",
"decision whether or not you agree, which I just think is a mistake.   You're well known for having a very candid and open,",
Communication style,
"forthright style of communication. It's appreciated by Warren Buffett, he says he loves your chairman letters, and",
we obviously appreciate it here. What was it that led you to develop this style of communication early on?,
"I'm one of those who I don't think I've changed much since I've been eight.   When I got to Harvard Business School,",
"some of the advice I got when I was graduating was whatever you do, Jamie, don't go into corporate America, you won't survive.",
"And there was truth to that, I was a little too outspoken for some corporations etc,",
"and part of it was Warren Buffet. When I was in high school or college, I actually read his partnership letters.",
"He would say, I'll speak to you as if you're my smart sister who doesn't know everything I know, so I have to go out of my way to explain it to you.",
"Business is not that complicated, we should be able to explain it, I always felt exactly the same way. I always felt as a matter of principle inside a company,",
"if I allow spinning to the public, you are going to spin to me.",
"Think of earnings, numbers, how great we are doing when we're not and so I say the same thing to you that I say to my board, that I say to my shareholder,",
"I say to my employee, that I say to my customer. There is no difference. I might phrase it differently because you're talking to",
"different group of people and you're trying to explain yourself, but there is no difference, and that clarity, I think,",
"helps a company know what it's trying to accomplish all the time. When I read annual letters, and it's all gobbledygook in the letter, my respect for",
"the company drops a little bit. And then you gotta be very specific, because we can all say,",
"the customer is the most important thing, and the customer, the customer. But it should mean something specific like,",
"do you actually read customer complaints and then you do something about it as opposed to, we put the customer first.",
"A lot of people say that and they don't mean it in any way, shape, or form. They do no actions that would actually support the statement.",
Career in finance,
So this one I'm afraid I'm going to try to sneak in some more career advice. I think everyone here is aware that tech is extremely sexy right now.,
A little bit less so today.   Don't say today.    What do you think is the opportunity in a career in finance that,
"some in audience maybe aren't seeing?   First of all, one thing about tech, tech is driven I don't think it's different than it was before.",
"It's driven change throughout all of history, and all various forms of technology from the actual chips to Internet.",
"But also printing, energy, institutions, schools, the churches, the dissemination of morality.",
"That's what's always changed society. It's always at the root, it's at the root of changes in businesses,",
"it's at the root of changes in what companies do well and what companies don't do well, so it's absolutely critical.",
"I personally think Silicon Valley kind of got a free ride with Obama in the White House. You pandered to him and he pandered to you,",
"now you're seeing a little flip side of that. So the big companies, the successful ones are going to find out,",
"which I've known a long time. The bigger you are, the more the government's going to get inside what you do, and want to impose on you and set rules and standards,",
"and sometimes for good, sometimes not for good. But, so financial services, so I think technology's an absolutely wonderful thing.",
"But financial services, first of all, we are a huge user of technology. We spend $9 billion a year, so we're not at the bleeding edge, but",
"we're damn close. In terms of what we spend money on, what we do, our data centers, our capabilities,",
"our mobile, our digital. We move $6 trillion around the world every day digitally,",
"not cryptocurrency, but close to it because it's digital. And we bank 50 million people on our households and",
"soon we're going to have online investing and robo investing and all these various things to link in to our accounts, so we are huge users of that stuff.",
"We also use the advertising on Facebook and Google, etc. But financial services is always going to be an interesting business,",
"because it's not the most important business, but it is at the nexus of how a capitalist society functions.",
"It's part of the spinning wheel. And when I say financial service, I'm talking about all of it, private equity,",
"venture capital, activist, whether you like them or not, banks, nonbanks, individual investors.",
"A lot of companies that do things individually, that help change the world a little bit. But it's always going to this field that when money gets invested,",
"the ideas come together. Things get executed, capital gets executed globally. So it's always fascinating, it'll always be well paid,",
whatever some of these folks say in DC. It has to be well paid because you can't do it with dumb people making dumb,
"decisions, if you think you can actually run a good economy or something like that. It will always be a high tech user, and",
"it will always be complex and global by its nature. And so it's a fascinating business. When you wake up in the morning, when I read the paper,",
"there's very little in the paper that I'm not reading and thinking about. It affects our clients, it affects our companies, it affects our risk.",
"It affects our exposure, we should be doing something about it, like just any article. because we do business in well over a hundred countries, and with just about",
"every country and every sovereign wealth, and so it's a fascinating field. I mean, when you get into it, there are all different parts to it.",
"And you gotta decide if you want to get into it, how you want to get into that. One of the things we set up, which I really like, is,",
"we hired top-notch people from investment banking, okay, and sales and trading.",
"So we go to the best schools in the world, we hire some of the best people. We now do the same thing for general management, about eight or nine or",
"ten a year because we need people who can run the damn joint, too. And I want the same quality and we move around the company,",
"kind of keep an eye on them. But the point is, they want to be global, they want to move around, and",
"they want to learn how to manage and run something. So the same kind of compensation as investment bankers,",
"same openness to senior people, so that we can get them. Not that if you're an investment banker, you can't move into management or",
"sales and trading, but this is really people want to do more management of financial services.",
Crypto,
"You mentioned cryptocurrency. I know you said you weren't going to talk about Bitcoin anymore, but you're at Stanford. Some of us put all our student loan money into it.",
"And I have to ask you anyway, why do you believe that governments and regulators can't allow the existence of a global currency based on",
"I've become like a spokesman against BitCoin, I don't care about BitCoin. I could give a shit, to tell you the truth.",
"And I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it, the next day. There are four things really quickly, blockchain is real, it's technology,",
"it could be public or private, it could be for five people, it could be for 5 million. It's going to work. We already use it in a lot of test cases and stuff like that, so we're a supporter.",
"I do worry a little bit about the security because, like I said, we move $6 trillion a day, real time, quite efficiently, effectively and secure.",
"Before you replace that, you gotta    make sure you can do it right. There are three cryptocurrencies, okay, three types, three separate types.",
"One is ICOs, ICO and I haven't studied these things, but you're paying for",
"a token that allows you to use a service, which is very different than a currency, but that's what people call cryptocurrencies.",
"And maybe, Jim, maybe you've studied some of these ICOs, I have no idea. Someone gives you cloud services or you invest in services, that's one type.",
"The second type you can use cryptocurrency for fiat currency. Well, that works because it just uses different technology to move money around.",
"Basically we keep your money digitally anyway, and if you just keep different files in a different way and distributed ledgers, that would work fine.",
"But I've always thought about Bitcoin as a currency and a store value and a payment mechanism is that governments, and this is my belief and I'm maybe wrong.",
"I'm not telling you you can't go to $100,000. That governments are going to crush it one day for three reasons, okay?",
"One is when it's used for terrorist activities, okay? It'll happen, it's a matter of time, it'll go back to a Bitcoin and",
"then all of a sudden, the DOJ, the United State government, all these people in Washington who profess to love technology and",
"the novelty of Bitcoin are going to change their mind. Number two, when a lotta little old ladies lose their money. Because the speculative vehicle is allowed to exist by the United States government.",
"And they're going to lose their money, they're going to be pounding. You should of done something about it. And number three is the most important.",
"Whenever a government forms itself, and you go to any country in the world, pull out the currency, look at the date,",
that fiat currency was formed by that government with the central bank. Because governments like to control their currency.,
"They like to know who has it, where it's going, why it's going, when it went, etc., and right now, Bitcoin's a novelty.",
"It's $100 billion and $1 billion a day trades hands. Obviously, mostly speculation, okay?",
"And obviously, there's a real use case, I'm not making it as a joke. Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, criminal, drug money, that will always be true.",
"So we'll always have a use case that's valuable to someone because it's better in those countries to have that than currency or money in the bank,",
"because the governments, they take that too. And if you go to Argentina, they had effectively savings accounts,",
"the government just went in and took it. They just took it, and of course, everyone took their money out of the bank right",
"after that, and the country basically collapsed. So that's the reason why. It's going to get bigger and bigger and they're going to want to control it.",
"And it's not the same as a fiat currency. A fiat currency, the government says, you must take this as legal tender.",
"And at par, effectively cash, at par, and it's always worth par.",
And I don't know why a crypto dollar would ever be something that the store value would be worse than a crypto Bitcoin.,
"So that's my view and I may be wrong, which I doubt, but-",
"I've been wrong before, though. So, and if I'm wrong, I also don't care very much. It'll never affect my life.",
"It's not because they're right, or the bankers are defending their stuff. Absolutely untrue. If Bitcoin works and we have to do something, Bitcoin will do that too.",
Kind of a win-win there.        JP Morgan's a big investor in,
Blockchain,
"blockchain technology, as we've seen from Bitcoin. What do you think the most interesting applications of blockchain are going to",
"be in finance?   So blockchain, it's not like a faster chip or the Nvidia GPUs and",
"stuff like that, because when you get certain technologies, they just filter through the whole system.",
And they allow you to do things differently everywhere. Like more database and more reading different natural language processing.,
"You basically have to write code to have a use case for Bitcoin. So think of it, it'll be deployed use case by use case.",
We're using it to move money inside the bank. Something like 30 or 40% of the $6 trillion we move is just between JP Morgan Chase accounts.,
"Okay, that's sort of a marry area. From General Motors to one of your vendors when we have both the accounts,",
"we just move them between our own accounts, basically. Loan documents we do a trade, all the paper, all the detail,",
"all this notation, all the covenants, and all that can be kept in a place where you'll have the same files.",
"They're all kept up to date. You know who owns it, you know who doesn't own it, so that would be one.",
"Equity trading, I don't know the BitCoin takes ten minutes to finish. We do thousands and thousands of trades split second equities.",
So it may be too late to use for equity trading. It may be okay for end-of-day settlement stuff. So that's all use case by use case.,
"You can go through one by one and say it'll work here, it may not work there. But again, you gotta kind of write the code, or effectively rewrite the code.",
Trump Business Council,
"So we then moved from one hot topic to another. You are part of President Trump's business advisory board. Should it have been disbanded, and",
"where is that dialogue with the administration are taking place?   Yeah, so I joined the council, just keep in mind.",
"So when I joined the council, the President asked, Steve Schwartzman called up actually and said the President would like you to join his council.",
"I am a patriot, I love the United States of America, okay, and you want to help your country, and I still am going to help my country.",
"So help me God that is what I'm going to do whether or not you all like President Trump. And remember, we help presidents and prime ministers all around the world.",
I see them we advise them we give them this and we want to help the people of that country too. And that is part of your job as a bank and,
"as a individual to try to help to make the world a better place. I joined the council, I did get one very long well written elegant",
"nasty letter from my daughter, basically-        Basically, how could you Dad?",
"And my other two daughters were right to the point, ditto.        And my wife told me how many of her friends she had to explain it to.",
"Remember these are all liberal effete New Yorkers, in my opinion.",
I said I'm a patriot. It doesn't mean I agree with everything the man says or the way the man is himself. It's about trying to help the United States of America.,
"The council met twice, so think of these councils. The truth is they aren't particularly effective.",
I was at one. I don't know if Mary was at the second meeting. All right and I think the same was a lot like the first. You talk about the infrastructure.,
"You talk about this and the president is like, that's ridiculous. We get better at this. All true but at one point that work has got to be done in detail in the agencies.",
"Okay, not by a bunch of CEOs sitting around the table, telling you that it takes too long to build a bridge and",
this regulation hurts and we need this in capital markets. So the effectiveness comes down over time.,
"And then after, Charlotteville was the last straw but the negatives were going up. Most of us really believe in diversity.",
"LGBT, DOCA programs, we're pro immigrant, we're and we certainly wouldn't",
"justify any way shape of form, nazism or white supremacy or stuff like that.",
"So we found ourselves having to explain to our own people by the way, because the press was always calling me up and saying you should say something.",
I don't remember the press calling me up saying I had to go public every time I disagreed with something Obama did.,
"So the press really is extremely biased and they're going to have to do something about it. Not all, I mean they're all bias in their own way but",
having to explain it constantly over and over is just a negative. We had a conference call. Steve Swartzman was the chairman.,
"He ran it, we went alphabetically, everyone on the conference call said let's just disband it.",
"There were two said don't, having a seat at the table is a good thing etc., etc., and we disbanded it.",
"Of course Schwartzman told the President, and the thing that came out was that the President agreed to disband it which wasn't exactly the case.",
But everyone in that room is still working with the people they should be working with to help the United States government do proper things.,
"They need help. If you think somehow decisions are going to be made properly in Washington without the help of business, they won't.",
"We're all doing it in our own way and obviously, I do a lot with Monahan and Cohen And you have other people deal with other agencies, etc., but",
is you come up and try to help. And just because you don't like the president is a really bad idea. I think we become far too knee jerk in our politics and,
"to me, you should be willing to help.   Your name is-   Sorry.   Yeah   Yeah, I'm sorry go ahead.",
Treasury Secretary,
"Your name was thrown around a lot as a potential Secretary of Treasury. That didn't happen. But say you wake up tomorrow as the secretary, what does tax reform or",
"economic policy look like on the secretary diamond?   So, I don't want to be Secretary of Treasury.        But we have, and told you this is",
important this country has the best hand ever dealt any country in the planet.,
"And most people don't fully understand if they never make the list. So I always say we have a problem, make a list and go through what we think matters.",
And I'm going to do it quickly. We have all the food and water and energy that we need. We have the Atlantic and the Pacific which our founding fathers realize how powerful,
"it is to defend this country from wars in Asia, wars in Europe. We have the best military the world's ever seen. That's going to be true for a long period of time.",
"I say compare it to China, but do it respectfully. China does not have enough food, water and energy, and",
"it's neighbors happen to be Philippines, Japan, North Korea, South Korea,",
"Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Russia. And they've had border skirmishes or wars with five or",
"six of those in the last 40 years. They are in the a tough part of the world. So those leadership there are saying God, we need food.",
We need access to certain commodities. We have to have an army just to protect ourselves from the billions of people who,
"surround them that aren't necessarily that happy with them. So the United States also has and I got out of business school talking about Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan.",
"Then it was BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India, China. Then it was Mexico, MIST Mexico, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey.",
"But none of them have what I'm about to say, the universities we do, the rule of law like we do.",
"Low corruption like we do. The widest, deepest, most transparent markets the world has ever seen,",
"public and private. And again, I'm not talking about banks here. Okay, and hugely vibrant businesses small to large, and",
innovation like the world's never seen. And I'm not talking about just Silicon Valley.,
"I'm talking about you go to any company in America and believe me, they're getting productivity up 2% somewhere, okay?",
"And does Brazil have that? India, China, okay does most European countries have that whole list.",
"Does Mexico have it? That's the best hand. But something went wrong, and I do think we left behind a huge segment of sociaty.",
"10 million people left the workforce, but I think they're starting to come back in. 20 million people are felons, of which a large amount shouldn't be felons.",
"I tell people if you were caught doing some of the shit you did, you'd be a felon too. And you can't get a job after that.",
"Most companies, you're not going to get a job with JP Morgan by law from most of the jobs by regulatory rules and requirements Scotty.",
"We have the opioid crisis, I think we blamed trade immigration technology,",
but that's not really the reason. But we have some of these rustbelt towns left behind.,
"Our inner-city school kids 50% don't graduate, okay? And most of you didn't go to inter-city school.",
"But 50% don't graduate, they're mostly poor, they're mostly minorities in this land of opportunity.",
"There are 6 million open jobs today, good jobs that you can get out of high school. Welding, construction, electrical, coding, automotive,",
"there are automotive jobs everywhere, aviation, and we're not training the kids.",
"So that's why and that's also why I took on the chairman of the business round table. So the question I always have is, how do you fix that stuff?",
In reality I think the fix is actually known. I think the hard part is getting it through Congress. But competitive tax reform has to be done.,
"It shocks me that my democratic friends, and they say, are you going to change wages on day 1 of the 12 Corbett Tax Reform?",
That's their measure. What happened last time? That's their measure. The measure you should have is the counter factual.,
"Had you had competitive tax systems 10 years ago, there would probably have been $3 trillion retained here.",
"Companies and capital, 5,000 companies have been bought by foreign companies because it's advantages for them to own an American company now.",
"So while our government dawdled on these inversions, 5,000 companies were acquired by foreign companies, net, there's a study that came out by ENY that would have been retained here.",
Think of corporate headquarters and we damaged ourselves and it's permanent.,
"And that's 4 trillion overseas, and it's 4 trillion, someone has been reinvesting hard equipment in plant, and companies.",
"But there is still 2.5 trillion in cash. That's why it is there. And it's not because these companies are moral, it's because it's so",
much more advantageous to do stuff over there. Microsoft built a research center in Vancouver,
because they can hire the same kids in Seattle because of our immigration laws. And so these things have held back America.,
And I am absolutely convinced and it's hard to prove it because you can't put a model. We're growing at 2% in spite of the dumb things government's done for 10 years.,
"And had we done the right things around competitive taxes, infrastructure, education, we'd be growing at 3% or more.",
"This recovery, the growth is half of a normal recovery. A small business formation,",
"we're down net millions of small companies that normally would have been formed. And the reason is lack of access to credit, regulations.",
"And again I can't prove it, I'm trying, we're using big data now to try to get some of the stuff looking backwards. And so part of the agenda of the Trump administration is the right stuff,",
"infrastructure, education, competitive tax reform, proper regulation. All right, I'll just say proper as opposed to less or more,",
"they massively overdid it. You've heard people say that didn't hold back landing, okay.",
"And we did some real analysis and done by economist, not by me. Mortgages alone, we believe held back by $1-2 trillion because of the cost,",
"lack of securitization, lack of servicing requirements and because of litigation, stuff around it that people are mostly mortgage under rise",
"are willing to make mortgages to first time buyers, young people, immigrants, private defaults and self employed.",
"Not going back to the sub-prime of the old age, just open up the credit box a little bit, okay? $2 trillion of mortgages would've been probably 5% growth in GDP.",
That one thing. And yet they say it didn't hold back lending. And that would not have changed any risk at all for,
"banks, for the most part we don't keep that stuff. And it wouldn't have changed the risk for the government. Actually I think the risk is lower when the economy is stronger.",
And so that's what they should be doing and I think they are going to do some of that stuff I hope.,
JP Morgans loss,
Under your management at JP Morgan come from strength to strength but one instance stands out as a negative during your tenure.,
"So, in 2012 a London based trader lost over $6 billion for the bank. Are there any lessons for us all on how you dealt with that incident and",
"do you wish you'd done anything differently?   Here is an example. This is what our country has come to, okay?",
"We had a record profit that year. We're a big company, hugely embarrassed, and I'll tell you about that mistake in a second.",
"No customers were involved. Okay, it was originally pronounced a hedge, obviously it didn't work.",
And yet we were punished severely in congress. $2 billion of fines.,
It's outrageous. It's just outrageous that a company makes a mistake. My shareholders got hurt by 6 billion.,
"I hurt my shareholders, I apologize to my shareholders. And the government fines me 2 billion in addition to that, because they can.",
"Because they said, it's another example of a bank being mismanaged etc. You know, shit happens!    And it was, we had put on a hedge that was supposed to",
"earn a lot in a recession and basically break even in a normal thing,",
"and lose money in a booming environment. Think is, we were short high yield and long investment, something like that.",
"And it wasn't the complex derivatives that mattered. Because the fact is that wasn't the mistake. The mistake was when we put thing on, I thought and",
"again I blamed myself and I went public right away. Big mistake, 2 billion, could be a lot worse.",
"Bad strategy, barely vetted, barely monitored, barely done. My fault. I'm sorry. We're going to fix it.",
And the details in some ways didn't matter but there was this hugely liquid.,
"This typical thing in trading by the way. When we had asked them to reduce the positions in half, I had asked.",
I'd looked at some very simple numbers has asked me. I should have asked a couple more questions. They couldn't do it.,
"So instead of reducing it in half and saying we have a problem but if they said at that point in time we lost 500 million, you probably wouldn't have known about it.",
"But instead of that, they kind of doubled down. They tried to come up with these old cockamamie ways to reduce the risk. But they just added more and",
"more liquid positions on top of other liquid positions. And when you try to unwind that thing, that's how you get killed.",
"But the lesson, there's no lesson to me. I knew the second it happened. I've seen it before. I got the whole Mazarin team together and all the PR people.",
"I've said guys, they're going to come after us. They're going to say Jamie was like everybody else. Big banks are too big to manage.",
"Jamie Dimon is a failure just like these other guys. He's off his highly holy horse, diamonds do break, diamond in the rough.",
"I wrote all the headlines.        I said forget all of that stuff,",
"we're here to serve companies, serve clients. We're going to do our jobs and hopefully the attack by the, and",
"when something like that happens, and a lot of you have been through this. That is a letter to every AG, to every newspaper, to every senator,",
to every congressman. And they'll attack like literary like a bunch of barking hyenas.,
"And yet we all look it like that's okay but it's not okay. It's not the way professionals, people should act when companies have proms and",
"stuff like that. So the fact is, there was no great lesson learned. Other than follow you, whenever you have a problem and I say Zuckerberg's got one,",
"that's what he going to deal with and I'm not sure he completely understands that. Every AG, every Senator, every Congressman, they'll turn immediately,",
"they'll go on the attack, they'll take advantage of it. I'm surprised they are not talking about fining them billions of dollars yet.",
"And so and that's just society, you just have to learn how to deal with that stuff. So and the biggest risk of all, the risk committees,",
"we obviously bear risk all around the world. That risk committee which was meeting, had a senior risk officer on it.",
"When I asked what about this trade, they said no, that trade was done pretty much between the bunch of those traders who",
"were doing it, and Ira Sho who's our CIO who I respect. They didn't want to share the risk committee.",
"That should never happen, ever, ever, ever, ever. Okay, our risk committees see everything, my general counsel sees everything,",
"my head of compliance sees everything. Once someone ever says, well that we're going to do over here, you've got a problem.",
"And that tends to create an issue that will come back and haunt you.   To explore leadership in tough situations some more,",
Creating a work culture,
the Harvey Weinstein's story is very much on people's minds at he moment. As a leader what do you feel is your role to play in creating a work culture that is,
very respectful of women?   Well I think it is your role to do that and.,
"And someone who said to me about that Harvey Weinstein, so Wall Street has been that way. Wall Street is not that way today folks, not like that stuff.",
"I mean I'm sure there may be harassment somewhere at J.P. Morgan, but if you think it's condoned by anyone at the company in a senior position, absolutely not!",
"Okay and we've got strict processes in place to look at what people do, and how they do it, and review it.",
"And if it involved me in any way, shape, or form, it would go directly to a separate board thing. It wouldn't be like I could go negotiate a settlement on my own or",
"something like that. So the first thing to Diversity, and I think it's more important",
than anything else is that everyone in the company is treated with trust and respect. Any meeting you walk in you feel like you're welcome.,
"Anyone can speak up. You see the subtle guy thing. I've seen this, a senior banker once told me Jamie, watch this man who runs",
"a big part of the company walk into the partner's room and he'll walk up to you. Hey buddy, how did you like that football game?",
"Hey man, what was your score in golf? I mean, and he wouldn't even talk to the women in the room?",
"If you're managing a group of people and I saw you do that, you'd get an earful from me. You've got to talk to everyone.",
"You can like some people more than others, but you've got to talk to everyone. And you have to go out of your way to get the quiet person, the reserved person,",
"the person who doesn't want to be embarrassed to get them to speak up and feel comfortable. And when you have an environment of trust and respect, people can shine.",
"Okay, now you should have specialized programs and all that, and I'm for those, but they don't work if you don't create that environment.",
"Doesn't matter. You just said you would advise it. I have three daughters. If they were in a terrible environment, I'd tell them to leave.",
Go find a place that appreciates your skills. And so it will hurt a company ultimately because if I get to pick my team from,
"all people, not just white men, I would pick a far better team. I should point out that at JP Morgan Chase, and again,",
"the press doesn't write this, half of my direct reports are women. Did you hear what I just said?",
"Every article, even in the Wall Street Journal is always saying, it'll be 30 years before women represent 30% of the executive suite on Wall Street.",
"50% including the head of tech now, Lori Behr, who's been doing a great job, she's been there a couple of months.",
"20% of my direct reports are LGBT, because they're good.",
"And 30% of all of the top 200 people in the company are women, and they run major",
"parts of the company, credit card, private banking, global equity, capital markets.",
"An Indian woman is the head of US M&A. And that was the most macho belt and suspenders,",
smoking cigar in the backroom of all the jobs.        And her father didn't even want her to go to school or college.,
"She's actually from India. She actually Indian, and so, yeah. I think if you do it right you'll have a great environment for everybody.",
"And you gotta have your eyes open to it. What I was worried about is not, we have 5,000 branches.",
"And I just always know that in that branch, that guy or woman but mostly the guy, can be a bully and get away with it because we can't see it.",
"And no matter what we say, the people in that branch, they need their job and they put up with it.",
"Another one you shouldn't allow. And I'm sure you've been in companies, you should never allow, and it came to my attention, you are not allowed to have a golf event,",
"invite the men in the division and not the women, just not allowed. My first inclination would be to fire someone on the spot if I heard about that.",
"And don't have golf, do something different. And go out of your way to make everyone feel accepted, and",
you'll build a great company.   One question we often ask female CEOs here is how they manage work-life balance.,
Managing worklife balance,
We rarely ask male CEOs. But I've heard a story that you once threatened to quit your first job because a partner forced you to work over the weekend unnecessarily.,
We're not suggesting that JP Morgan investment analysts stop doing the same.        But do you have any tips for,
"us on structuring our time, balancing demands made of us, and sorting priorities?   When I was an analyst at this consulting company,",
"this consultant had said you've got to do this work. I need it Monday morning, 9 o'clock. He gave me the assignment Friday,",
"which all the people in Wall Street complain about. The kids are right. MDs, they come in, partners, and they're not thinking about it till Friday.",
"And on Friday, I need this. I need this, I need it Monday. Which means you gotta work all weekend. And most of the time you could have gotten the assignment on Tuesday.",
And so we've actually tried to institute some policies like you can't give people assignments on Friday basically anymore unless it's approved by someone senior.,
But I worked all weekend and then I show up at 9 o'clock. And I was in the library basically doing research and stuff like that.,
"And he wasn't there and he called in at 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock and said, Robin, I worked all weekend.",
"You said 9 o'clock, it was critical. He said I didn't really need it until tomorrow. I just want to make sure you got it done, to which I was, bye.",
"And I told him I'll never work for you again. Now this is not advice, okay?",
My advice would be a temper is not a good thing.,
"And they said, well, you can't tell the consulting firm who you're going to work for. I said yes, I can, because they can fire me.",
"I was quite serious. I never worked for the person again. And I think that was a bully thing. That was my instinct, that was just bullying me, and",
it was completely unnecessary. And he knew me well enough to know that I was going to get down when I told them I was going to get down stuff like that.,
"You can have work-life balance. When I tell people at JP Morgan Chase, it is your job to take care of your mind,",
"your body, your spirit, your soul, your friends, your family, your health. Your job, it's not our job.",
"So I think there's a little bit of misunderstanding that some of the companies. Now we should do everything we can to help you, right?",
"I tell people, we give you medical, shrinks, Pilates, massages.",
"I mean, we really do try to take care of people, but I can't make up for you not doing those other things.",
"You really have to do it yourself. Most people don't work very smart. So first off, work smart.",
"I do emails and phone calls generally once, okay? I have three types of reading, very fast, fast, very slow.",
So the very slow is the complex. I really need to think about it. Very fast might be a magazine.,
"I just want to see if there is something interesting in there or something like that. People don't run their lives efficiently. And I'm sure you've seen even in school here, people are frenzied,",
"they're always frenzied. They're late, they can't get back, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, I couldn't get this done. I got my cases, I couldn't do this.",
"If you're frenzied, it's you. It's not the school, it's not the job, it's you because a lot of us aren't frenzied.",
"I'm never late, almost never late.",
"I'm not frenzied. I have a nice. I know exactly what people are doing. I schedule time for myself for exercise, and for making my phone calls.",
"And if I didn't do it this morning, I would feel harried if I wasn't all caught up.",
"So work really smart. Learn how to work smart. And then, in I think it's really difficult when you have children.",
"That does burn the candle at both ends. My advice to men, is you better drop watching every football game and",
"playing golf on both Saturday and Sunday. Do something with your kids. If you don't, it's neglect.",
"Okay, you call it whatever you want, but I have a lot of friends complain that they have no family time. But they go play golf on Saturday and Sunday.",
"I'm playing golf on Saturday and Sunday means you wake up at 7, right? You go play golf for three hours. You have lunch, usually a Bloody Mary, you go home and take a nap.",
"Okay, and then you go to dinner with friends. You should have done something with your family.",
"And so you can do it. And if you're a woman, I think it's even harder. And I think there's some jobs that are really conducive to helping you, and",
"some aren't. And you gotta think that through a little bit. And one of the greatest speech I ever saw a woman give was, you can have it all,",
"you just can't have it all at the same time. And just be a little thoughtful how you manage your life. That could be a man who's gotta stay at home to take care of kids, or",
sick parents or something like that. And so it's a long race and you can pretty much do it all.,
But you gotta make sure you save time for yourself to do those things. And even the toughest job you can do that.,
Battling throat cancer,
In 2014 you continued to actively lead JP Morgan despite battling and defeating throat cancer.,
Many people were incredibly impressed by your decision to stay at the helm with the company during that time. What continues to motivate you under those circumstances?,
"Well, it's not up to me to stand down with the company. You're never quite over with cancer either.",
"At first, I had to go public with it. It wasn't my preference, but I couldn't be seen walking in and out of Sloan Kettering.",
"And of course I was going to lose weight. I didn't lose my hair, but I could have, and all that. So I just went completely clean.",
"I did go to work, almost every day. But that does not mean I worked every day.",
"I mean I was taking four or five naps, I lost like 40 pounds and I didn't want to get close to anyone because your immune system is virtually gone.",
So I didn't even want to get a cold at that point. But people say so I was sitting at home and,
"I go get my treatment every morning radiation and then I'd go home. I'd try to exercise, I went from running five miles to walking five, to",
"literally walking for a minute, going on the floor because I was going to pass out, walking a minute, but it made me feel better.",
But if I stayed at home you know what I was doing? I couldn't read I thought I could read eight hours a day but,
"I just couldn't do it but I was staying home I was watching ISIS and Ebola.      And when I go to the office,",
I'm surrounded by friends and interesting things and you keep mind well. I had some meeting and so it was better for me.,
And the board was fully beefed the whole time and I have unbelievable management team and they were great. And my family is great and so it was,
"in some ways a heart warming experience other than the fact that it's terrifying.   Jamie thank you so much, I think we'll now turn it over to the audience for Q&A.",
Thank you so much for being here Mister Diamond. At what level do you think BitCoin has to get to before,
"JP Morgan would embrace it and at what level of demand? You said there is a level and I'm wondering what that would be as look today at the price of $7,000 a coin.",
I doubt we're going to embrace it at any price. So I mean to me it's that I'm worried about,
"being caught up in this maelstrom of people losing money, and stuff like that, there's no reason for us to do anything with Bitcoin.",
"Now, if you're a client, and you're going to trade it on the CMU, or something like that, I'd advise you not to do it, but should we do it and",
"put in trades for a client who asked us, who is sophisticated, and obviously not bright, but sophisticated.",
"Maybe, I don't know. I mean and I told the senior team I don't tell them what to do,",
"I told to place a note to Daniel and I said Daniel I know you heard what I said, it's your job to what you do.",
"And if you disagree with me that's completely fine. I'll probably do whatever he wants, inspite what I said.",
"Hi, hello, hi thanks for coming. One thing, I'm I'm a second year MBA.",
Lessons Learned,
"A couple things you said that were quite interesting were that there is no lesson to be learned, and I don't care if I'm wrong.",
And I guess from a lot of senior leaders I've noticed that self-awareness and learning from mistakes or key characteristics?,
"Do you agree, and if so, do you have an example of a time when you've actually tried to build those?",
"Yeah, so I did mention mistakes I've made. I should have asked some more questions. There's one question I would've known.",
Just one. There's the one where I said it was a tempest in a teapot. I asked the question. I got the wrong answer.,
"It was, how liquid are the positions? How many days can you get out? I was told ten.",
"Yeah, it was like hundreds and the second I heard that, I said, shit. We have a real problem.",
"So you learn. And I actually wrote about it in my chairman's lever. I said, lessons learned or relearned. I knew that.",
"It's like you kind of sometimes learn the same lessons over and over. It's like being in a boxing ring, They say duck, hold your hands up.",
"Yeah, well, That's harder to do than you think. So you do learn, you do get better as you get older in management and people and",
decision making. But I'll tell you what the biggest mistakes I've made are.,
They're not the specific one like the London Whale but more the patterns around it. Temper's a bad idea.,
"Any decision made out of temper, even treating people with temper you They're always being careful.",
"While you walk in, which mood is he in, and stuff like that. You don't get the best out of people. And sometimes earlier in my life, it was said, it was a well placed blow of anger.",
"No, it wasn't. It was just a welling up of anger. It usually clouded your judgement, as opposed to.",
"So, I knew I'd finally matured when about 10 years ago, I said,",
someone was sitting in front of me talking about something. It was about investment banker comp. And I was getting so mad.,
"And I said, you know what? I'm going to leave the room. You guys stay here for ten minutes.",
"I'm going to come back. I went out. I thought about what made me mad. I came back. I told them very politely How offensive what they were saying was to me, etc.",
"But other mistakes, when you don't get the right people involved, plain and simple.",
Sometimes the answer is waiting to be found. You just have to get the people in the room to work it. Making decisions when you're tired.,
"Making decisions on Friday. Not throughly vetting people, the biggest mistakes you make are people mistakes and",
I've made plenty. The people mistakes really set back an organization because it takes a long time to figure it out.,
"And a lot of damage can be done, then you have to replace them, so it's like a year and a half. A person mistake takes a year and a half of setting the company back.",
And you may lose good people in the meantime because when you put a person in that job they often drive out some other good people by the time you figured out you made a mistake.,
And you can avoid that because I dont know your name but I can get the whole book on you and never meet you.,
"Okay I can find out how smart you are, how you treat people. How you treat your friends, bosses, peers, subordinates, whether you're on time,",
"whether you show up, whether people trust you, whether you shave the truth. I get that whole dossier on you. So we're pretty good now at making sure when we put people on these big",
"jobs that we know they're pretty good. You still can make a mistake, but you'd be surprised, the error rate is just dramatically less than it ever was before.",
Future of European Financial Services,
Hello. Hi. I'm a 2018 Sloan fellow. I was working for JP Morgan in London up until March of this year and,
I was just wondering where do you see the future of European financial services and particularly JP Morgan in the context of Brexit?,
"So Brexit I mean the fact is we're going to be prepared for hard Brexit not because we're predicting, though I think it is pretty likely at this point.",
"All right I think it's a very complex thing, it's not great for Brittain. But the fact is to be prepared all we have to do is have our European subsidiaries",
"get more capital, certain licenses, certain approvals which we're going to get. So if you're had the hard Brexit it defaults the next day the existing EU law.",
Under existing EU law we simply have to do certain things contractually in sovereign in entities in the EU.,
"And we have them we've got licences, proper subsidiaries and In Germany,",
"Ireland, Brussels, it's only about 500 jobs, so it's not that big a deal, but in",
"reality 12,000 people are servicing Europe out of London, even after a hard Brexit. And the real issue is what happens to the 12,000 in the 10 years after?",
Because I know it's going to happen Regulators and politicians are going to walk in and say we're uncomfortable.,
We know you did the license and you booked the trade of this subsidiary but you know back to back to that subsidiary to risk manage it where you have the banker do the ECM deal here but,
"the research, risk, compliance, audit, trading was all done in London.",
"And that's not sufficient we don't want to pretend we can grow this type of business you gotta move it here. I think there's going to be huge pressure moving those 12,000 people over time",
into the EU. And my goal is to make sure we conserve our clients none stop.,
It will cost us more money it's a real pain in the ass. But that's not the point I am worried about it. I want to be able to serve those European clients.,
"And we bank every European country just about Every big European institution, every big European investor that's what I gotta worry about being",
"prepared to do that on the next day.   Thank you this is a continuation of what you're talking about, but",
Technology Disruption,
what areas of the bank do you see most exposed to technology disruption?,
"You mentioned sales and trading before Yeah so first of all like I said technology has been changing the world forever, so",
"it's not like it's completely different. I think it's faster now, more money is going into fintech.",
Agile technology can do things that couldn't be done before. And I think it's incompetent upon any business to use technology to do a better,
"for its client. Better could be better, faster, cheaper, straight through processing obviously making a digital mobile, stuff like that.",
"I remember banks have been doing that for years and you can buy and sell effects on our on your mobile phone now. And when some trade, some trader did a $400 million trade and",
"I said, God, $400 million on a mobile phone. I said we've gotta put breathalyzers on those phones.",
"I just envisioned some macho trader having two martinis and saying, I'm going to do this.",
"But you know what? When I mentioned that to the risk people they said, we do have that. And we can actually put that in, so that you can't do a trade without",
"breathalyzer or something like. Anyway. So I think, in some ways, always look at a business from the standpoint of the client.",
"So forget J.P. Morgan. A lot of the things the clients need, they're still going to need.",
"In fact, they'll need you to go overtime. ECM will still be there, DCM will be still there. Hedging FX and hedging interest rates will still be there.",
"M&A advice will still be there, but we have to use technology to do things better, faster, quicker like everybody else.",
"And straight through and all that kind of stuff. But you ask me the thing that's going to be most disrupted, it's going to be payments.",
"There are payment systems that you're integrating. All the HCh Systems, terrible. But we just put out a P2P.",
"You all use Venmo? We just put out a P2P, it's realtime. Bank to bank. It's safer, it's better, it's realtime, it's not social yet.",
"So I don't possibly understand why you'd want to share all that stuff with your friends, but could be that, it could be in wholesale payments.",
"But you could go on screens now move money around the world, convert to different currencies. And so we're doing it, but",
"if you ask me that's where most of stuff going to take place. Remember, we've invested in 100 Fintech companies and",
"we're going to compete, build, buy, whatever it is. And just give you an example, we're going to have online trading and",
"mobile investing for our clients. It's in beta today, I'm not sure I'm going to roll it out. We're going to roll it out and test it and test price and all the stuffs like that,",
"but we can analog those things for free if we wanted to. So we're not, we're not dead in the water.",
"So when the time comes, you are going to see us being very aggressive to win businesses like we always have.",
"We rolled out, it's not being marketed, we rolled out a mobile-only bank in St. Louis recently and we are going to test that.",
"More for millennials than anyone else, but from opening the account to moving money, it's only a debit card.",
And we're going to see how that works and then we are going to try to modify that and then do it in all 50 states.,
bureaucratization,
"Go ahead. They'll get it eventually. No, hold it up.   Jonathan Walden, third year PhD student now and",
"I have a question about how you brought up bureaucracy and politicalization, and the detriments that does to the firm.",
And my concern is how do you assess the bureaucratization within J.P.,
"Morgan, compared with your peers. And how do you trade off the agency that you give to individual portfolio managers",
"with the oversight from compliance? Well, we're pretty rigorous how we run the company, so we meet all the time, and",
"go through everything top to bottom, and we raises issues and stuff like that. So you know who your authorities are if you're a trader.",
"If you're a bank, you know exactly. You also know he's not supposed to do, and you also when you go to compliance committee, risk committee, an underwriting committee, or",
"a credit committee, there's no mystery to any of that. And it happens every day and we barely make mistakes. And I'm not going to stand behind the regulatory things, and we have a thousand",
"new rules and regular requirements and that does create some of the bureaucracy, but it's not an excuse for us to say, this is a better way to do it.",
"We listen to customers all the time. The management team is open, every issue, the agenda is always set by them.",
"So it isn't like you walk in the room and I set the agenda. If you work for me, I expect you to raise everything important.",
"Everything and anything including bureaucracies, cost slow down, bad service, competitors got something better than us.",
"That's your job not my job and, so I mean, I do it with you hoping presumably you're going to do it with your management team.",
"So you're always airing all this issues. We go on bus trips, we go to call centers, we go to op centers, we got client reviews, we got advisory groups, and all those things get circulated all of them.",
So all the complaints we're always trying to deal with that become better and faster. I think one of the tough things about management is,
"you have to get rid of the bad people. So I can say anything I want, but if I have a bunch of goomas,",
"or they're not that good, or they're friends of Jamie type of thing. That is what caused the problem.",
"And so very well from people who were on going to get rid of the bad people. Bad could be, because their culture is bad and also because they're not good.",
"They're not good enough. So in meritocracy people say, Joe deserves the job or",
good old Joe and spending a long time. That doesn't mean they deserve the job. And in sports if you're not batting 250 you're not going to be playing,
"second base. And it's very easy, you take out a pitcher that's not doing a good job. In business there are left in those jobs a long time.",
"I'm not saying treat them disrespectfully. If you treat people disrespectfully, you're going to lose their hearts and minds too.",
"So it's gotta be a very respectful, we're going to make a change for the following reasons. But you really,",
"if you're going to run a real meritocracy, you've gotta make sure you really do it. And those people, it should filter through the whole company.",
"Loyalty is such a misnamed thing sometimes. What they usually mean is, I was asked when I was a young CEO in a room like",
"this, we had just done a big deal, how can we be loyal to you when you weren't loyal to Joe? He's been around. He trained a lot of people in the room and you just demoted him.",
"I couldn't answer the question. And I called the person the next day, and I answer every question eventually by the way. But I called him the next day and I said, I thought about it and",
you got it backwards. If I was loyal to Joe and kept him in the job. And most people thought he just wasn't doing a good job anymore.,
Who am I being disloyal to? Everybody else and the customer. And so it's a hard thing to do but and,
"that's the hardest thing to do in management right there. And a lot of you will fail doing it, because you deal the thin hams in",
"management, you're owned by this desk down the hall and they all take care of it. Don't worry I'll take care of it and basically that becomes a club.",
"And they're not taking care of it for the company or the client. They're taking care of it generally for themselves. And so you have to be very, very careful in management, why you're doing what",
"you're doing, and who gets to speak up and who's in the room and things like that.",
Artificial intelligence,
We got time for one more question.   So I worked for J.P.,
"Morgan Chase back in 2012, part of the team that redesigned the chase.com. So I do know Chase is always more towards the technically advanced company.",
"And this question is more toward the tech side. What is the stand of backing community in AI, artificial intelligence?",
"Like AI is going to take over automation stuff.   Yeah.   And what does banking community thinks about it?   Well, I don't care what banking community think,",
"I'll tell you what I think. Big data, AI, machine learning, chat boxes, roblox, they're all real.",
"We have thousands in data scientists and PhDs and not just coding. And we spent $9 billion a year in technology, $700 million in cyber,",
probably $1 billion a year now and just some of these stuff just uniquely devoted to that.,
"And it is real it is an amazing thing that you can do, that you can do today in a split second so we just to, when you swiped that credit card,",
it goes through hundreds maybe a thousand algorithms to test for fraud how you did it where you did it what time.,
"We do the same thing for big payments. So if you run a company, small business large company, like what happened to the Federal Reserve never happened to us.",
"Payments at the wrong time, different type, different entry, we're actually monitoring your systems all the time. If we see anything wrong we're calling you up and stuff like that, so it's real.",
"The hardest part about it isn't understanding it or knowing the technology, it's getting the people in the company to understand the power of it.",
"So when we first started big data, and big data and we put it up at the central for standards, and we used Hadoop.",
To make sure that you don't end up with 84 different platforms and stuff like that out of control. And machine learning has another problem with regulation that I won't go through,
"but we put it at the top. And we had to say, hey, you do prospecting, how do you do it, why do you do it?",
"We made prospecting ten time more efficient in a commercial bank. Ten times and don't think, okay, the cost is lower, instead of $30,000 it's $3,000,",
"it also means we can put two more bankers in Grand Rapids. It's a huge benefit to the company, and",
"be immediately productive as opposed to take three years to build it up. And then once we did that, we now have it in every division.",
"So every division has a big data, AI, machine learning thing. And we ask every manager, come back and",
give us the use case that you think is best for you. The demand is going up like this. But it's one of the areas you want the demand.,
"You want to spend more money. Obviously, you want to spend it wisely but we push people. So in technology, I always do that. You can't ever say to me you didn't do it because of the budget or",
"you couldn't afford it. it is not allowed, you have to put in your budget sort of a reflection of",
"a 12 month of a plan, you have to put in a plan everything you need to do. Going to sales force,",
"going to companies going to technology, do not be a baby about it, because people say, well we did not do it, because we could not afford it, who said?",
"We can afford anything we want. We spend $58 billion a year, we make $35 billion pretax, if you guys put on the $2 billion to get big data right, we're going to do it.",
"So it's more about the getting executed right than it is about the money.   Everyone, please join me in thanking Jamie Dimon.",
good morning welcome to Google i/o I,
love you guys do,
can't believe it's one year already a,
beautiful day we've been joined by over,
"7,000 people and we are live-streaming",
this as always to over 400 events in 85,
countries last year was a tenth year,
since Google i/o started and so we moved,
it closer to home at Shoreline back,
where it all began,
seems to have gone well I checked the,
Wikipedia entry from last year there,
were some mentions of sunburn so we have,
plenty of sunscreen all around it's on,
us use it liberally it's been a very,
busy year since last year no different,
from my 13 years at Google that's,
because we've been focused evermore on,
our core mission of organizing the,
world's information and we are doing it,
for everyone and we approach it by,
applying deep computer science and,
technical insights to solve problems at,
scale that approach is served us very,
very well this is what has allowed us to,
scale up seven of our most important,
products and platforms to over a billion,
monthly active users each and it's not,
the not just the scale at which these,
products are working users engage with,
them very heavily YouTube's not just as,
over a billion users but every single,
day uses watch over 1 billion hours of,
videos on YouTube Google Maps every,
single day users navigate over 1 billion,
kilometers with Google Maps so the scale,
is inspiring to see and there are other,
products approaching the scale we,
launched Google Drive five years ago and,
today it is over 800 million monthly,
active users,
every single week that are over three,
billion objects uploaded to Google Drive,
two years ago at Google i/o we launched,
photos as a way to organize users photos,
using machine learning and today we are,
over 500 million active users and every,
single day users upload 1.2 billion,
photos to Google so the scale of these,
products are amazing but they are all,
still working up their way towards,
Android which I'm excited as of this,
week we crossed over 2 billion active,
devices of Android as you can see that,
the robot is pretty happy - behind me so,
it's a privilege to serve users of this,
scale and this is all because of the,
growth of mobile and smartphones but,
computing is evolving again we spoke,
last year about this important shift in,
computing from a mobile first to AI,
first approach mobile made us reimagine,
every product we were working on we had,
to take into account that the user,
interaction model it's fundamentally,
changed with multi-touch location,
identity payments and so on similarly in,
AI first world we are rethinking all our,
products and applying machine learning,
and AI to solve user problems and we are,
doing this across every one of our,
products so today if you use Google,
search we rank differently using machine,
learning or if you're using Google Maps,
Street View automatically recognizes,
restaurant signs,
street signs using machine learning duo,
with video calling uses machine learning,
for low bandwidth situations and smart,
reply in a low last year had great,
reception and so today we are excited,
that we are rolling out smart reply to,
over 1 billion users of Gmail,
it works really well here's a sample,
email if you get a email like this the,
machine learning systems learn to be,
conversational and it can reply and find,
what Saturday or,
so it's really nice to see just like,
with every platform shift how users,
interact with computing changes mobile,
brought multi-touch we evolved beyond,
keyboard and mouse,
similarly we now have voice and vision,
as new to new important modalities for,
computing humans are interacting with,
computing in more natural and immersive,
ways let's start with voice we've been,
using voice as an input across many of,
our products that's because computers,
are getting much better at understanding,
speech we have had significant,
breakthroughs but the pace and even,
since last year has been pretty amazing,
to see our word error rate continuously,
improve even in very noisy environments,
this is why if you speak to Google on,
your phone or Google home we can pick up,
your voice accurately even in noisy,
environments when we were shipping,
Google home we had originally planned to,
include 8 microphones so that we could,
accurately locate the source of read,
where the user was speaking from but,
thanks to deep learning use a technique,
called neural beamforming we were able,
to ship it with just two microphones and,
achieve the same quality deep learning,
is what allowed us about two weeks ago,
to announce support for multiple users,
in Google home so that we can recognize,
up to six people in your house and,
personalize the experience for each and,
everyone so voice is becoming an,
important modality in our products the,
same thing is happening with vision,
similar to speech we are seeing great,
improvements in computer vision so when,
we look at a picture like this we are,
able to understand the attributes behind,
the picture we realize it's your boy in,
a birthday party there was cake and,
family in wall and your boy was happy so,
we can understand all that better now,
and our computer vision systems now for,
the task of image recognition are even,
better than humans so it's,
pounding progress and be using it across,
a product so if you use the Google pixel,
it has the best-in-class camera and we,
do do a lot of work with computer vision,
you can take a low-light picture like,
this which is noisy and we automatically,
make it much clearer for you or coming,
or coming very soon if you take a,
picture of your daughter at a baseball,
game and there is something obstructing,
it we can do the hard work remove the,
obstruction and have the picture of what,
matters you in front of you we are,
clearly at an inflection point with,
vision and so today we are announcing a,
new initiative called Google is Google,
AM is a set of vision based computing,
capabilities that can understand what,
you're looking at and help you take,
action based on that information we will,
ship it first in Google assistant and,
photos and it will come to other,
products so how does it work so for,
example if you run into something and,
you want to know what it is say a flower,
you can invoke google lens from your,
assistant point your phone at it and we,
can tell you what floor it is it's great,
for someone like me with allergies or if,
you've ever been at a friend's place and,
you've crawled under a desk just to get,
the username and password from a Wi-Fi,
router you can point your phone at,
and we can automatically do the hard,
work for you or if you're walking in a,
street downtown and you see a set of,
restaurants across you you can point,
your phone because we know where you are,
and we have our knowledge graph and we,
know what you're looking at we can give,
you the right information in a,
meaningful way as you can see we are,
beginning to understand images and,
videos all of Google was built because,
we started understanding text and,
webpages so the fact that computers can,
understand images and videos has,
profound implications for our core,
mission when we started working on,
search we wanted to do it at scale this,
is why we rethought our computational,
architecture we designed our data,
centers from the ground up and we put a,
lot of effort in them now that we are,
evolving for this machine learning and,
AI world we are rethinking our,
computational architecture again we are,
building what we think of as AI first,
data centers this is why last year we,
launched the tensor processing units,
they are custom hardware for machine,
learning they were about 15 to 30 times,
faster on 30 to 80 times more power,
efficient than CPUs and GPUs at that,
time we use DP use across all our,
products every time you do a search,
every time you speak to Google in fact,
DP user what powered alphago in its,
historic match against laser at all as,
you know machine learning has two,
components training that is how we build,
a neural @v we you know training is very,
computationally intensive and inferences,
what we do at real time so that when you,
show it a picture we recognize whether,
it's a dog or a cat and so on last,
year's TPU software optimized for,
inference training is computationally,
very intensive to give you a sense,
each one of our machine translation,
models takes a training of over three,
billion words for a week on about 100,
GPUs so we've been working hard and I'm,
really excited to announce our next,
generation of TP use cloud TP use which,
are optimized for both training and,
inference what you see behind me is one,
cloud TPU board it has four chips in it,
and each board is capable of 180,
trillion floating point operations per,
second and you know we have designed it,
for our data center so you can easily,
stack them you can put 64 of these into,
one big supercomputer we call these TPU,
parts and each part is capable of 11.5,
peda flops it is the important advance,
in technical infrastructure for the AI,
era the reason we enabled named it cloud,
TPU is because we are bringing it,
through the Google cloud platform,
so cloud GPUs are coming to Google,
compute engine as of today we want,
Google cloud to be the best cloud for,
machine learning and so we want to,
provide our customers with a wide range,
of hardware beats CPUs GPUs including,
the great GPS Nvidia announced last week,
and now cloud TPS so this lays the,
foundation for significant progress,
"Well, hello and good afternoon,",
"good morning, wherever you are in the world. My name is Lilah Jones, and I lead one of the fastest growing",
divisions in Google Cloud here in North Central with a team of great people. And I also co-lead our Women at Google Chicago chapter.,
"Today, I am so thrilled to be able to host an amazing speaker, an amazing person, an amazing CEO, Indra",
"Nooyi.     Lilah, great to see you.",
"It's wonderful to see you, as well. When I think about your amazing credentials,",
you've been one of the most loved CEOs. You've been the first woman trailblazer,
to hold a CEO position in a Fortune 50 company. You've won tons of awards for all of the work,
that you've done in society and in business. And I can't tell you how many people look up to you,
"and see you as just a beacon of hope for all of us still building our career, so welcome.",
"Thank you for taking the time. Thank you for doing this work. Thank you for being with us.     Lilah, thank you for having me.",
It's a pleasure to talk with you. It's a privilege to talk with you. So I'm looking forward to our conversation.      So we started talking about this,
"because this amazing new book you have-- amazing new book that talks about your life, your work,",
"families, and the future. It talks about-- and I won't give away too much of it, but it really talks about being able to connect",
"some of the links between work, family, and career. And I love one of the things that you said in the book",
"that talks about this not being a memoir for you, but really being a manual for the rest of us",
"who are out here working to build our careers, taking care of young children, taking care of older aging",
"elderly parents, and also trying to make a difference in our society and communities.",
So this talk is really about what inspired you to write that and some of the background that helped,
"you put your thoughts together to make this amazing book.     That's a great question, Lilah.",
"In fact, it goes back to the opening comments that you made. You talked about being a role model, people looking up to me,",
"and the fact that you accomplish a lot in your life. At least, in retrospect, you feel",
"like you've lived a good life in terms of professional, having the family.",
"But living a good life doesn't mean you just abandon everything after you retire, because life is well",
"beyond your time as a CEO. The real question is, how can you continue to make positive change in the world and in society?",
"And in my case, I decided that I would lean in to make positive change in two areas.",
"One, I noticed that a lot of young women in managerial ranks came into the workforce in large numbers",
"and dropped out in the second or third level, because they just couldn't figure out how to make motherhood and rising in the corporate world",
"possible. Because the corporate world is a pyramid. I mean, it's a steep pyramid. And if you sort of take a detour or you drop out,",
"it's very hard to come back. So first, we need to figure out how to make more of them ascend to the top,",
because women are basically wicked smart. And they're very talented. And they should be deployed in all of the productive jobs that,
"will help the economy. So that's one challenge. The other challenge, I think, is even more emotionally difficult",
"to come to terms with, because I'm surprised we haven't done much about it. When we talked about the pandemic and all",
"that happened during that time, there were a whole group of workers who couldn't work flexibly.",
"Our teachers, our hospital caregivers, our senior citizen caregivers, in retail, in hospitality--",
"they all had to go to work every day. And many of them, with schools closed, didn't know what to do about childcare or senior care.",
And many of them had to go into work and stay away for two or three weeks for quarantine reasons.,
"And so if you look at all of our frontline workers across the economy, they are the people that keep the wheels of the economy going.",
"And if you look at a lot of those jobs, like caregiving jobs, they're all skewed towards women.",
"They don't have good childcare facilities. Either they're not affordable, they're not available,",
"or the quality is not very good. So here I was confronting two problems, which are very well-known to all of us.",
"At the managerial level, how do you provide a support system to move women up the ladder?",
"But on the frontline, how do you just allow young family builders and women in particular",
"just do the work that they want to do in order to support their families, but that also helps the economy?",
And I think we have to stop talking about this issue as being their problem. I think it's now our collective challenge to address.,
"And so it's these twin challenges that caused me to write the book. And people said, if you just wrote a paper on this,",
nobody will read it. And it won't have stickiness. Can you inform it with the arc of your life?,
So the arc of my life informs a lot of the managerial issues that women face.,
"And then my co-chairmanship of ReOpen Connecticut brought home to life the whole frontline worker,",
"the essential worker's plight. And putting the two together, I realized the problems",
and the solutions are the same. It's how we address it that's going to be the big challenge going forward.,
That's fantastic. I recall reading about some of the work that you were doing to reopen Connecticut and the framework,
"that you were working to put in place with a team. That's awesome. Now, it's interesting.",
"As I listen to you communicate, you are a wonderful presenter, of course. And one of the challenges that women often have--",
"and maybe not just women, all people have-- is speaking up, and using their voice in the way",
"that they communicate, and being able to share their ideas. And I recall reading in the book that you were always",
a part of the debate team. You always spoke up. You spoke politics in the men's salon inside of your house--,
in the men's living room inside of your house. And so I'm curious to know what feedback you would give,
or what advice you have for people on clearly communicating and sharing their ideas in a way that matters.,
"Very important skill. I think communication skills, both oral and written-- but let's stay with the oral communication skills.",
"If you have good oral communication skills, it can actually get you very far. But let me be clear what I mean by good oral communication",
skills. It's not reading a speech. A lot of people can do that. It's not looking at a teleprompter and just reading.,
"Many people can do that, too. The issue is, when you read it, how do you make the words go into somebody's emotion",
as opposed to somebody's ears? How do you deliver the speech so people,
"know it's your speech as opposed to you reading somebody else's speech? And more importantly, when you speak",
"without a speech in front of you, Lilah, the person who's listening to you should be able to form a picture in their head of what",
"you're talking about. So even the most complex subjects, break it down to its component pieces",
and deliver it so that people can form a picture in their minds right away.,
"That's a skill that's teachable, that's trainable, that's practicable, if you want to call it that.",
"But I think that we have to equip people with that capability, because as you become a leader, as you",
"ascend, you have to constantly mobilize your troops to come along with you. And you can't always pick up a piece of paper",
and read from it. And you can't always just repeat what you're saying and expect to get the same result if it hasn't,
"gotten the result so far. So at every point in time, you have to tune the speech to the audience.",
You have to create vivid pictures in their mind and constantly let these pictures evolve,
so it goes from the mind-- from the head to the heart. And that's the skill that we all have to teach people.,
And it comes with watching great speaker-- one of the greatest speakers I've ever heard was Vernon Jordan.,
"Vernon Jordan, when he spoke, knew which line to emphasize the second or the third time.",
"And he knew which part of the audience to look at and emphasize a line. He knew when to slow down, when to pick up.",
"I mean, he had the gift of speaking. And we should encourage people to listen",
"to Vernon Jordan's speeches. Bill Clinton is another great speaker who can take a simple subject, make it too complex,",
and then simplify it again. But it creates a picture in your head. So if you look at some of these great speakers,
"and listen to them, I think we can all get better at this particular skill-- critical skill to move ahead.",
"I love that you mentioned that. As somebody who trains and engages with salespeople often, I'm always talking about, don't just",
focus on the products and the services. What's the why? What's the story? How does that touch people? So I really appreciate you underscoring that.,
"I noticed, also, that in reading the book and looking at your story, you were one of the first women of color in a Fortune 50 company--",
one and only. And I think about the passage in your book where you talked about when you were interviewing.,
"I believe it was at Yale, and you didn't have the right clothes, or you didn't have the right outfits, and how",
people didn't necessarily receive you like they received others. It would be great to learn more about that experience.,
"I want to first put this whole thing the right timing. It's 1978, '79. This was a long, long, long time ago.",
"And there weren't that many international students in many universities here. And there were certainly no women, colored women,",
"coming from emerging markets to study here. So these are very, very early days.",
"So there wasn't an infrastructure built to provide support to people like me who came with no idea of how to dress, how to behave,",
"how to interact. I mean, just had no knowledge. So you sort of sink or swim.",
"You learn to just watch others and get better as you went along. And my first summer job interview at Yale, I just",
didn't know what to wear. I had saris. And I had some awful jeans and tops. I really couldn't wear either to the interview.,
"So I went to Kresge's, which is a K-Mart equivalent on Chapel street in New Haven, and bought myself",
"an outfit, which cost less than $50 because that's all I had, which I was very proud of.",
"But when I wore it, it looked pretty bad on me. And people laughed at me when I walked into the career office.",
"But it was too late, because I had an interview. And I needed the job, because I have to support myself in the summer.",
"So I walked in and gave the interview with great confidence, but feeling terrible inside, because I knew that I looked like a disaster.",
"Then I came out and spoke to the career office, who said, yeah, you look pretty bad. So your next interview-- because we were all sure I wouldn't get",
"this job-- your next interview, wear a sari, because that's all you have. And if people don't hire you for who you are, it's their loss.",
"So the next day, I wore a sari to a consulting interview, and I got the job. But what was ironic, Lilah, is this job",
"that I interviewed for day one with this lousy outfit, they too offered me one of the two jobs",
that they offered that day. So I realized that I'd come to a country where people were more interested in what,
"you had to say as opposed to how you looked or how you acted. So I had a positive experience, because people",
"viewed me and said, boy, she might actually have something to contribute.      That's fantastic.",
They looked beyond that absolutely ghastly outfit.,
"Many of us have had nowhere near that experience, but showing up in the wrong thing. So I think we can really relate to that awkward feeling.",
"So I mean, when you think about all that you've accomplished, and you think about rising to the top of PepsiCo--",
"something that you mentioned that, when you took the role, that wasn't even necessarily your goal. I think it was the fact that it was 15 minutes from your house,",
and you had a 10-year-old and a one-year-old. And the other offer that you had was a half an hour,
"away, so you took the PepsiCo role. I'm curious to know, what do you credit to your rise there?",
What do you credit to the success that you had there?     I think it was two things.,
"One is, clearly, I had to do my part. I worked my tail off. And I mentioned in the book that I always",
"had this immigrant fear. And I walk into a room, and I say, god, I'm so different. Nobody else like me.",
"Therefore, people must be asking themselves the question, why is she at this table? Why is she in this room? Why is she giving us advice?",
"Or why is she working on the project? I just had that complex in me, all right? So I would dig myself into a hole.",
And then I would have to find a way to come out of the hole. And I knew the only way I could do it is by showing that I was on top of the material.,
"I prepared everything. And I knew more about what needed to get done than anybody in the room. So I had to do it with sheer grit, and knowledge, and depth",
"of expertise. That's all I had to focus on. So that's all I did. I focused on the knowledge base, on competence,",
on thinking about the issue at the detail level and at a higher level.,
So I was zooming in and zooming out of every issue. And so I came to the table with those skills.,
"And after a while, people look past-- just like that interview we talked about-- looked past who I was, my background,",
"or how I looked, or talked, or whatever, and said, man, here's somebody who actually has some great points",
"to make. I mean, there were some uncomfortable moments. I wouldn't say that everything was smooth sailing.",
"But on balance, I'd say, people said, if she's so well-prepared and knows her stuff, why not lean in and listen to her?",
"So it went from, who is she? To maybe she belongs here, to, boy, we better listen to her.",
"So it went to that. And pretty soon I was invited to most meetings, even if the meeting didn't really",
"relate to my area of work. People just invite me and said, just have Indra come sit. Who knows?",
She may have a point of view. So I earned a place there. That was one side.,
The other side was the CEOs and the senior executives that I worked with gave me support.,
"They would say, what does Indra have to say on this topic, or make sure you run this by Indra",
"before you bring it to me? And so by explicitly saying that, they were messaging the senior executives that, if you came and told me",
"that Indra's approved it or not approved it-- you ran it by her, and she was comfortable with it-- it's easier for you to get an approval from me.",
"So they were giving me an indirect boost. So I think this combination, actually-- I earned it, Lilah.",
I want to be clear. I earned it. But they gave me an added boost to what I brought to the table.,
"And they were all men, incidentally, because there were no women. There were no women in senior positions in those days.",
"It's interesting when you talk about challenges that you faced and using your voice,",
I'm curious to know some of the major challenges you tackled and how you went about that.,
I recall you mentioning as a CEO for 12 years the amount of pressure that you're,
"under to manage expectations, and how you're probably always solving some level of problem.",
"I'm curious to know about your time there. What were some of the toughest things that you had to handle, and then what methodology did you use to be successful",
"at that?     Well, let's just talk about my CEO tenure, because if we talk about my entire tenure,",
"we could be here the rest of the evening. In my CEO tenure, when I took over as CEO,",
"let's not forget we had the financial crisis. So here I am. Literally a year after I've taken over,",
"we've got a collapse of the financial system. The US was going through its crisis. International was growing, and PepsiCo's",
more of a US company than international. So I have to figure out how to sort of add,
"to my international portfolio really fast. So I have to get that done. While that's going on, my North American bottling partners",
are behaving in a little erratic way so that I have to figure out how to reset the relationship with them.,
"So that's another challenge I'm facing. On top of that, there was a lot of talk about obesity and taxes",
"on our categories. So in every which way that I turned, there's some crisis that I'm dealing with.",
"But you can't let that get you down, because the whole organization is looking",
"at you to lead the company calmly, with confidence, thoughtfully.",
"So what you do is exterior-wise you project a very calm confident image. You can go inside your office and paddle very, very",
"furiously, which is what I was doing. In those moments, it was tough, because there's so many balls",
that you've got in the air trying to get all of that done. You hope that you can power the company through so,
"much change, that all your key executives stay with you through this change, because you can't do it yourself.",
"You need them all on your team. So you've got to co-opt them. You've got to engage them head, heart, and hands, make sure they understand",
your agenda. So it was-- those were very difficult times.,
"While delivering the quarter, don't forget. We can't forget the quarter-- while delivering the quarter. So I remember now that, between the time",
"I was CFO, president and CFO, and CEO, I delivered 75 quarters of earnings releases--",
75 quarters. I was on the call of 75 quarters of earnings releases.,
"So you had to keep that pressure going to deliver the quarter, yet make all of these changes happen.",
It was not easy. Not easy at all.      That's a lot of quarters.,
"Man, I just-- I'm like--     That is a lot of quarters, yeah.      I can't even imagine",
"what that must have been like and just the experiences that you had from that. But I'm curious to know, in all of that,",
"what were some of the main lessons that you learned, or what were some of the main things that taught you about leadership in business?",
"I think the first one is really understand what you're doing, have conviction in what you're doing,",
"and make sure that your board, in particular-- as a CEO, you have to make sure your bosses-- that's the board--",
"buys into what you're doing, because they're your first line of defense against any action",
"from shareholders. So if your board has bought into you, you know you have some room to get your plan executed.",
"So you have to have clarity of direction, clarity of how you're going to implement it. And you've got to have the board completely bought",
"into what you're doing. At the same time, you've got to sell your programming to your senior executives and your-- at the top three levels",
"of the company, because at the end of the day, you've got to make it happen through them-- through them.",
They have to carry your message. They have to make sure the rest of the organization lines up.,
"And so the challenge we have is, in the hours of the day, how do you craft the message, get the board signed up?",
And you just don't get them signed up once and walk away. You've got to reinforce it regularly with the board,
"and get your senior executives signed on. But then those that don't, after a while, you say,",
"look, it's time to leave, because you can try with them for a few months, but if they still don't sign on to the program,",
"they've got to be moved out. Otherwise, they become sort of the stumbling blocks in the company.",
And so we had to move out some of the people through retirements. But all of this took a lot of time.,
And you had to do all this while keeping the current business running and keeping a family going.,
"So I'd say that that particular time when we were trying to effect a major change,",
"and implement performance with purpose, and navigate through the financial crisis and the bottling transactions was perhaps",
"the most difficult time of my professional life. But all in the public eye, because everybody",
"is watching to see, is this woman going to succeed? Not as a CEO-- is this woman going to succeed?",
Is this person of color who is an immigrant going to succeed as a CEO of this Fortune 50 iconic company?,
So everybody is watching to see when you're going to fail-- when you're going to fail.,
"And so it was tough in those days. Really tough. And social media doesn't help, because anything you say or do",
gets amplified on social media. So one had to be very careful navigating through all,
"the crises at that time. But I had a great team around me, Lilah. I had a really good team around me.",
"Indra, from reading the book, I know you come from a background where you really developed a lot of grit, perseverance,",
"and patience. And I won't be a spoiler alert, but I have to imagine that some of that helped prepare you for some of those challenges.",
"But I am going to switch to another topic, and that is that around mentorship. Oftentimes, when I do talks and work with different groups,",
"women in particular are saying, Lilah, how do I go about finding a mentor? How do I find a sponsor?",
Why is it even important? And there's all this angst around that particular process.,
"And if I recall, in one of your first jobs, you had in a textile company, the CEO",
"would come to your house, have tea with your parents, and how weird you found that, and how he pushed you to go",
"and do the next thing. And so I'm sure there were other mentor relationships that you had, but I'm curious to know more about them",
and how you cultivated them.     So mentors by themselves are not good enough.,
"But if they're supporters and promoters, besides being mentors, it's great. A few observations-- mentors pick you.",
You can't pick them. They pick you because they see something in you that they like.,
And they think you are somebody who is going to go places or can go places with just a little push.,
"So they say, hey, I see something in this person. I want to make sure that I advance their interests,",
because these people can be molded into something much bigger than they are today. So mentors pick you.,
And then they transition to supporters and promoters. But the very important lesson with mentors--,
"you have to respect them. And if you go to them for advice, and they give you advice, and you choose not to take it,",
"you've got to go back to them and say, let me tell you why I didn't take your advice. Because if you ignore their advice",
"and do whatever you want to do, they'll never give you advice again. They won't be available for you again.",
So all the mentors I've had-- and I've had mentors or supporters in every job,
"in every part of my life. And until today, they are my lifelong friends. And I have to tell you that all of those people,",
"if I sought them out for any advice and always go back to them and tell them how I took it,",
"or how I modified it, or how I didn't take it. And it's a two-way street.",
"And if you don't treat mentors with respect that they deserve, shame on you.",
"So think hard before you go-- I mean, before you identify somebody who you think is your mentor or supporter.",
They emerge from nowhere.      It's interesting how you really,
underscore mentors pick you. They pick you.,
And I think a lot of times people are confused about that. So thank you for giving us that wisdom on how to go about that.,
"So in your career, there had to be pivotal moments that really helped",
you move to the next level. I'm curious to know-- and the audience is curious to know--,
what were those moments? What were those one or two times or one or two decisions that had the most impact on you being,
"able to rise to the level of success that you've had?     I think that, in every job that I was in,",
I never ever worried about the next job. I focused on the job I had.,
"I mean, just focused on doing the job I had very, very well. I'm thinking back to all the jobs I've had in my life.",
"And by focusing on the job I had and doing a great job with that, people realized that I",
wasn't interested in promoting myself or looking for the next job or the next job. But I was putting the company before me,
"to say, how can I do my job so well that the company's benefited from it or by it?",
"And I think that made a huge difference, Lilah, because there were times when somebody would say, could you take on more responsibility?",
"For example, the best is when we were doing the Quaker Oats acquisition, when the CEO walked into my office and said,",
I need you to take on the FTC process to get the approval from the competition authorities.,
"I didn't know anything about FTC. And I'd never been a lawyer, so I didn't know the process.",
"And I kept looking at them, saying, I'm too busy. I've got way too much on my plate. I can't do it. And his point was, I need you to do it,",
because I need to have confidence that it will get done. You don't have to do it. The lawyers will do it. But I need you to be the oversight for it.,
"And I thought long and hard. And I said, OK, I'll do it. So in addition to my jobs, I did the oversight of the FTC",
process and gave them the comfort that I put the company before me.,
"Similarly, when I was transferred to London in 1976,",
"I think it was-- no, I joined PepsiCo in 1994. '96, I was transferred to London.",
"And the new CEO said, oh, you're not going to London, because I need you in purchase.",
"It was disappointing. But as my husband said, put your company before yourself. If the company needs you in purchase, stay in purchase.",
"So, Lilah, I think that, if you talk about the big moments in my life, it's where I put the company before me.",
"I put the job I was doing ahead of any advancement. Because, look, if you did the job well",
"and advancements don't come, shame on the company. Shame on the company, because the company should want people",
"who are highly qualified. I just focused on the job that needed to get done. The one other thing I did, which I would encourage",
"a lot of people to focus on-- when I did the job, I just didn't do the job. I looked at all the connections and linkages",
of what I was doing to other pieces of work that were going on around me.,
"So I'd say, look, I'm doing this. Can I open up a little bit of what you're doing so it's easy to transition from my piece",
to yours? As opposed to let's just touch briefly. I wanted a little bit of overlap to every module.,
So I'd almost map out how my module was going to fit into a broader tapestry of work that,
"was going on to make sure together we would add value in the company. So again, this all came under this overall umbrella",
"of, how is the work I'm doing benefiting the company? As opposed to, how do I just do a job?",
"It was, how do I add value to the company? How are we making a difference?",
Why is the job I'm doing or the project I'm working on right now important for the company?,
"It was always that way.      I appreciate you mentioning that, if you're doing a great job",
"and your company doesn't notice, it's shame on them. That's a very important piece of it, as well. I know, as women, oftentimes we don't advocate for ourselves.",
And so kind of knowing what the balance there is is super important. So thanks for calling that out.,
You've heard a lot-- and all of us have been in lots of conversations lately-- around diversity and inclusion.,
"And I know that you're a huge supporter of that. You've always talked about how allies can ensure that people aren't being talked over,",
"or if somebody rolls their eyes, kind of waiting and finding out why did you not accept that point of view, and really being tuned into people's engagement.",
I'd love to learn more about how you might instruct or advise leaders who want to cultivate more in the DEI space.,
"Diversity and anything to do with just plain diversity is numbers. Do you have diversity, or what is diversity?",
It's a very mathematical thing. Inclusion is a state of mind. So I think if you focus on diversity,
"and don't focus on inclusion, or retention, and development, and promotion, then you really don't have a DEI program.",
"Because what you're trying to do is meet some external critic's desire to meet some numbers, but you're not making the effort",
"to make them fit in, make them feel included in meetings, giving them the kind of stretch assignments",
"you would give to other people, and helping them get to these goals that you set for them. So I think we all have to practice inclusion",
"in a much more meaningful way, because that's really",
"what makes diversity work. And usually, when you don't practice inclusion,",
"you strip away a diverse person's confidence, which strips away their competence. And a doom loop begins.",
"So when we talk about people talking over you, or rolling their eyes, or ignoring you and not inviting you to meetings,",
that's all behavior that smacks of non-inclusiveness.,
"So I think we have to be very, very conscious about that. Now, let's talk about inclusiveness.",
"I credit my previous CEO, Steve Reinemund, with a lot of progress being made on diversity and inclusion, because he",
"said something profound. He said, you can't build an inclusion program if you don't have a critical mass of diversity.",
"He said, look, if you have a small group of diverse people, how do you spread this message of inclusiveness--",
inclusivity across the company? So step one is get a critical mass of diverse people.,
"And then build the inclusiveness platform over that. Teach people how to practice inclusive behavior,",
"be more thoughtful about what they say, and call them out when there's bad behavior.",
"So he put in place a scorecard, which is parity hiring, parity promotion, parity retention.",
"It was way ahead of its time. And everybody fought it, including me, saying, hey, we can't hire anybody, because you said parity.",
"There's four people we have to hire. Two people have to be diverse. Can't find them. He'd say, go look harder.",
"Remember, this was a white man who was saying, I don't care, guys. We need to take this seriously, or we",
"don't talk about it at all. I think, if we want to be a successful company, we will take it seriously. So we brought the diverse numbers into the company.",
"And when we looked hard, we found them-- highly talented, diverse people. And then we put all the inclusion training.",
"So people were sensitized to how they're behaving with diverse people, the kinds of unconscious behaviors that actually",
had a profound impact on diverse people of every kind. And so by layering on the inclusion training,
"on a critical mass of diverse people, we could make progress. We could call out each other.",
Senior executives could call out bad behavior when they saw it. I honestly believe that diversity and inclusion cannot,
"be delegated to one person, like a D&I officer, and say, I got a D&I officer. Therefore, I'm done.",
Diversity and inclusion has to be in the CEO's mandate. It's got to be in the senior executives' objectives.,
It's got to be a boardroom discussion if you want to take it seriously. And HR departments should be held,
accountable for making sure that the behavior in the company supports inclusiveness--,
"inclusion, inclusive behavior.      I recall that you mentioned-- and I'm just",
"stunned over here listening, because I love how action-oriented what you're saying is and how much accountability is in what you're saying.",
"I recall you saying in another talk around, hey, the first time you share with somebody that this is not",
"OK or the way you're interfacing is not OK, and you educate. The next time, you might warn them. The third time, it's time to take action.",
"And oftentimes, that can be what's missing in some of these initiatives. Like, where's the action?",
"So I really appreciate you--     A word when it happens. Don't wait for months or weeks, because then everybody rewrites",
"history or people forget. Do it when it happens. And if you don't do it, people around you should do it.",
"People in power, if they see this behavior, should do it.      Thank you for calling that out.",
"So let's talk about support. And I know that, in your memoir, and in this guide,",
"and this manual, you talk about your mother. And that really touched me, because in your discussion",
"about her, you talked about how her family didn't have the money to send her to college",
"and to further her education, how she really wanted to support you girls in ensuring",
"that you had this amazing education and all these opportunities. But she was also a little bit conflicted,",
because there were all these social norms and cultural norms that were also associated with being a women at that time.,
"And so I'd love to know, throughout your career-- and again, throughout the book, you talk about your mom and your mom's support,",
and how much that impacted your ability to move forward.     I want to first give credit to my grandfather,
"and my father, too, because the men in our family believed that the women and men should be equally educated,",
should be allowed to dream as much as they wanted. There will be no discrimination against men and women.,
"Now, again, to put it in context, this is in the late '50s and early '60s in India.",
"And India has just come out of British rule. After 350 years of being ruled by the British,",
"India is now an independent country. So I'm born eight years after India was independent. So it's very, very early in the emergence of India.",
"Society is conservative. My mother was brilliant. Would have loved to have studied,",
"but she wasn't given an opportunity, because girls those days didn't go to college. They got married at 18 and were homemakers.",
"So she lived her life vicariously through her daughters. But she also had to conform to the social norms, which",
"said that daughters had to get married at age 18. So she had this foot on the brake. And the foot on the accelerator said, go off.",
"Dream big. Do whatever you want. And my dad and my grandfather put their foot heavily on the accelerator and said, soar.",
Not just dream big. Soar. We will provide the tailwinds for you. So this combination allowed us to have a little bit,
"of a frame in our life. So we had discipline. We had rules, strict rules, which is a good thing, Lilah,",
which is a good thing. We had the support of family. We had that base. We had accountability.,
"But we could also soar. We could dream big. And as long as we conformed within the frame,",
"we could do what we wanted. And I think it's that combination, the brake and the accelerator, that worked so well.",
"And I would never ever fault my parents' foot on the brake, my mother's foot on the brake.",
"It was the right thing to do, because she had to survive in society, too. And I love the fact that my mom, dad, and grandpa",
"put a foot on the accelerator, too, because they believed in us. And I think today, in all families,",
they should look at men and women the same. Everybody should be educated. Everybody should be allowed to soar.,
"Everybody should have responsibility for children and family creation, men and women alike.",
And I think what was harder in those days should,
"be a fact of life today.      I love the parts where you talked about your grandfather,",
"and sitting at his feet, and how he would have worksheets for you over and above what they had at school,",
"and how he made you read the newspaper, making you think he couldn't read it.",
But he actually knew. He just wanted to expose you to all of that. What a wonderful gift.,
"I can't help but notice, though-- think about that, how we're coming full-circle. A multigenerational household-- you had your grandfather.",
"You had your mom and dad. And then I know you had cousins and things who would come at certain times, because your house was",
"fairly large. And I'm curious to know, as we bring that to now, and support systems, and as we start the conversation off,",
"people who have children, people who have elderly or parents who are growing old-- how would you",
"change the infrastructure to support that better now? Because, certainly, none of us could do what your mom did and also build a career.",
So I'm just curious to know what support systems and how you think that should change.,
"I think families are very important, however we define family, Lilah. It's a group of people coming together",
that care for each other. Let me put it that way. Those are important infrastructures.,
You need that infrastructure to be able to have this emotional connection,
with a group of people who you know care about you deeply. So we have to think about how to rebuild,
"that infrastructure in our communities, in our little towns, wherever we can.",
"We have to rebuild those. And all of those have to get rebuilt in civic centers, and barbershops, and libraries,",
"and park benches. We have to start trusting each other a bit more, because in many places,",
we've all moved away from where our parents are. And we have to recreate some version of family where we are.,
And there's got to be some intergenerational help. We have an aging population.,
How can the aging population serve as the role that my grandfather played in my family? Doesn't have to be a direct grandfather.,
"It can be somebody who says, hey, for two days of the week, I'm going to read books to the young people in the park.",
"Come on down. Sit around me, and I'll read you a book. So the old days of recreating those social",
infrastructures so that we can actually come together as a society and help each other out at a point,
"when we need more talent in the workforce. And women are just doing so well in colleges,",
"getting all the top degrees, top grades.",
70% of high school valedictorians are women. We need that brainpower to work in our economy.,
"But we also need kids. So we need a whole ecosystem, a village, to help us be the support structure so",
that we can have families and also engage in paid work. It's an economic necessity to have,
women engaged in paid work. It's an economic necessity for young families,
"to be created so that we can support the aging, and we can provide people for all the jobs of the future.",
"We know it's a double economic necessity, so let's view this-- all of us-- as economists and not just",
say this whole argument is a feminist argument. I'm all for equality. All for equality.,
"But this is an economic argument to say, let's provide the support structure.",
Let's think about how to rebuild trust in societies so that we can all help each other out.,
And let's figure out how to take away the stress on young family builders and women in particular so,
that they can play multiple roles that we ask of them.      I think that is something,
"that is so incredibly needed. And I love that point of view of, hey, it's not just about gender or anything like that.",
"It is about, really, what we need for the economy. We'll go down to our next question, which",
"is our last question before we open up the Q&A, because I know we've got a lot of folks who are like, I've got a question. I've got a question.",
"And that's really building on the comments you made about women and women's support systems. And we'd be curious to know, how did you",
"build your network of women over time? And then, how can women who are coming up now who may or may",
"not be as connected as they'd like to be go about doing the same?     To be honest, when I was working,",
"there weren't any women to connect with. So when I became CEO, I brought the other women CEOs",
and the budding CEOs together in my home. And we met a couple of times.,
"And then one of the other CEOs said they'd take all the responsibility for the next meeting or two. And nothing happened, because everybody was just too busy",
doing their own thing. But we need to have these support structures,
so we can call out each other when things go wrong. We can provide a support and a shoulder,
"when things don't go so well. And I'm not sure we do a good job with that, Lilah.",
I'm not sure the sisterhood of women is as strong supporting each other as they could be.,
"And I think we all need to open our eyes a lot more to say, are we open to advice from other women?",
"Do we feel comfortable that it's good advice, as opposed to saying, I'd rather take advice from a man than a woman?",
"Are we open to it? Second, are we willing to trust other women who work with us, that each of us is worried about--",
are focused on the best interests of the person that's seeking the advice or you're giving them the advice.,
So I think that our sisterhood needs to mature a bit.,
"And it's very, very important that we reach a point where it's like, there's trust.",
"We don't judge each other, but help each other. And we also protect you.",
"If you are subject to any sort of unconscious bias, we blow the whistle and say, hey, stop it.",
"I notice this bad behavior. Let's make sure we stop it. As a group, we talk about it.",
"And so I think our sisterhood is still in the early stages, but we need to get going fast",
"Well, you have got me going. I will tell you that. I am so excited. And I'm nodding to everything that you're saying, because it",
truly resonates with me. And I know it resonates with all of those who are listening. And to be able to have somebody who's,
accomplished as much as you have and has endured as much as you've had to endure share this knowledge,
and these nuggets with us is just magical. It is absolutely magical. And I'm so grateful and appreciative of it.,
"Thank you, Lilah. Thank you. It was such a pleasure to talk with you.      And so now we have an opportunity, Indra,",
to open it up for Q&A. And I am going to be the one who reads some of these questions that,
are coming in. So let's go ahead and cue up the first question.,
"How did you break your deep-rooted Indian conditioning and expectations of balancing a family and a husband,",
"having a stronger career, and other cultural expectations? She's just shooting out from the-- she's ready to go.",
She wants to know.     The interesting thing is I married somebody who believed that we are equal,
"partners, absolutely equal partners. And it didn't matter which of the two of us",
"was doing better or worse, or going ahead or not. It didn't matter. We were equal partners. When we came to the house, we were both equal partners",
parenting our kids. And that was a commitment we made to each other,
"when we got married. And what was more remarkable is his family also felt that way, which is very unusual.",
"So I must say I got the luck of the draw here. His family said, we will let Indra",
"do whatever she wants to do. She needs to soar, let her soar. We'll support you, guys. Don't worry about it.",
"And even today, many of his old uncles and aunts will call and say, how's Indra doing? I've just finished chapter four of the book.",
"I'm now on chapter five. They send comments and questions. So it's very important that you marry the right person,",
"because typically you end up getting married to somebody who doesn't want you to work, or expects you to play a different role at home.",
"It's not possible. If you want to soar, if you really want to have a career that moves ahead, you've got to have support at home.",
You've got to have less pressure at home. And you've got to have clear ground rules with your spouses to equality in the marriage.,
"I mean, you're going to support your spouse, too, at times. Don't get me wrong. There were times when he's gone for six months",
"at a time, when he was taking care of his father. I said, go. That's important. I'll take care of the household. Don't worry about it.",
I gave him no pressure. So I think you've got to have that understanding. You've got to approach it with equality.,
"Very important. And then families have to commit to not giving you any added grief, especially",
in an Indian environment.      Thank you for that. I think that so often we all try to do it all.,
"And without some of those balances and those checks that you talked about, it's very, very difficult. I recall",
"you mentioning how you decided to get married to Raj, and how it was quite different.",
"But I won't be a spoiler. I'll let everybody else read the book. But it was just very, very non-traditional and very,",
very interesting.     That's why we're still married.      Exactly. 40 years later. All right.,
We'll take the next question.,
"How did you manage your time so effectively between your role, family, mentorships,",
and the entire spectrum? So what did you do to go about prioritizing and getting,
"things done?     First of all, the word effectively is an overstatement, because I'm very honest in telling you",
"that I was not the perfect mom, the perfect executive, perfect daughter, perfect daughter-in-law. I was not.",
"I juggled through all of those. And at every point in time, somebody",
"would remind me that I wasn't available here, or i wasn't quite there. Because the job needed me, and I was",
"responsible for so many people, I prioritized PepsiCo first. Because 260,000 employees were looking for the CEO",
"to provide direction. And then between my husband and I, we somehow managed all of our other priorities",
"and the extended family. The thing I'm envious about, Lilah, is the technology that we have today.",
"If I'd had all of these teleconferencing technologies-- FaceTime, the chat, the talks--",
"can you imagine? I could have actually gone home at 3:30. I could have spent time with the kids,",
"taken the kids off the bus, and then continued working from home. I need not have traveled as much as I did--",
"I was on the plane all the time. I may not have done that, because I could have had a lot of meetings through these technology tools.",
"So in a way, I wish all this technology had been available when I was a CEO or maybe even",
"when I was president, because that's when I had to travel a lot. My kids were even smaller, because I could have spent",
"a lot more time with them. And so I would say to all of the young people today, take this technology and the tools",
"that you have as a gift, and figure out how to engineer a support structure around this.",
"And I'm a bad example of a person that traveled all the time, was in the office all the time,",
because I had no choice. You have the benefit of fantastic technology tools,
"that are only going to get better. If Google has its way, they're going to make things way better than they are today.",
I have great confidence in your company. The only key thing is-- here's a request.,
"You should tell your Google leaders, put family and women in the center when you are developing",
these tools so that you make it easier for them to build young families and for women,
to not have to take a disproportionate share of the workload. Put families and women in the center,
of technology development. I think magic could happen.,
Amen on this side on that one. That is absolutely something that I mentioned earlier is near and dear to my heart.,
"So thank you for mentioning that. It's interesting. I also had a chance to meet with some women, and we were talking about wanting",
"to aspire to roles like yours, and to be just a little bit of what you've accomplished, and how we were like, hey, we don't",
know if we can do it the way they did it. And I love that you mentioned that we don't have to. It's a completely different world.,
And there's so many more options. So there's no need to be afraid to raise your hand to do more.,
"So thanks for that.     The thing that everybody has learned, Lilah, is lifelong learning.",
I think technology is changing so rapidly around us-- thanks to companies like Google--,
that everybody has to become a lifelong student just to keep up with the changing technology.,
"Because if you don't remain a lifelong student and let the technology get ahead of you,",
"you're going to fall behind. So keep in mind that, as you move up that pyramid-- especially those in managerial positions,",
"when you move up the pyramid, you're either up or out.",
"And so you've got to keep up with all of those changes to remain current, to remain relevant.",
"And just be prepared for all that. Look, it's a fantastic journey. You feel great. You're on an intellectual high.",
But don't get on a physical low. Use all the technologies to your advantage.,
"And you can do it. Seriously, you can do it.      I also love that you mentioned that it",
"doesn't have to be perfect. You weren't efficient at every single role all the time.     No.      I often say progress, not perfection.",
"A lot of times, we think that we have to be perfect at everything. And you mentioning that just proves that no, we don't.",
"You have to prioritize and do the best you can..     Well, the problem is we all have a perfection gene.",
"It's programmed in us, and so that keeps coming out and sort of bugging us at times.",
"But we've got to just start living life the way we want to, and say, look, this is the best we can do, and use",
"all the tools available around us, and create the support structures where they don't exist.",
"We can do it.      Wonderful. OK, let's go to the next question.",
Women who are first in their profession often have to rethink cultural narratives.,
What advice did you receive from family or friends that you realized in hindsight was a blessing to ignore?,
"Good question.     Look, had I stayed in India, there's a whole different set of things",
"that I could have stayed with or changed, because that would have been a culture I grew up in",
"and a culture that I was familiar with. But coming to the US, I had to decide",
"which of my cultural narratives should I keep, which ones should I modify,",
"and which ones should I completely give up to integrate. Because I've come to a different culture,",
there has to be some integration. So I grew up as a vegetarian.,
"I don't smoke. I don't drink. All of those, I kept. And I lead a pretty simple life, a good life.",
"All of those, I kept. But I also integrated. I love American sports.",
"I love football. I love baseball. I'm into it in a big way. I love music, American music.",
"I'm into everything-- country music, blues, rock and roll, pop. I'm into everything. Does that mean I gave up anything from my Indian roots",
and culture? No. I just kept the best of that and took on the most exciting parts,
"of the culture here-- the innovation, the entrepreneurship here, the incredible sense of can-do spirit",
"that exists in the United States. All of those I learned from, and I'm better for it.",
"That's why I came here. That's what excited me about the US. And I always say one thing, Lilah, my story",
"can only have happened in the United States, only in America. Let's not forget that.",
And so it can't happen with me trying to change everybody around me to accept me for who I was.,
I kept the best of who I was and took on the best of what I found here.,
And I am a great blend of the two. That's why I talk about my duality.,
"Wow. It's interesting, just letting that sink in, on how helpful that is when people",
"are trying to make those decisions and going back and forth. I also know from your book that you're a huge fan of cricket,",
as well. And don't you serve on  --some of those teams even now?     I can't walk away from them.,
Those are the things I grew up with. It's in your blood.      I think we might have,
"time for one more question. All right, this will be our last question.",
Did you ever actively plan and work towards becoming CEO? And what was that thought process?,
"Absolutely not. I did not actively plan and work towards being CEO. Had I done that, I would not have been CEO.",
"Interesting.     I think focus on the job you are doing very, very well.",
Put the company before you. And look and see how your job interacts with everything else around you.,
"And understand the politics, but don't play the politics. And invest in communication skills.",
Let me bring it all the way back to that. Invest in communication skills.,
"Project yourself based on your competence, nothing else. And everything else takes care of itself.",
"But if you sit there going, OK, I drew a 10-year plan.",
"I've got to be senior executive by year eight. I've got to be CEO by year 15, ain't going to work.",
"Because if it doesn't happen on that schedule, that's all you worry about all the time. Don't do that. It's not worth it.",
"And so I think we're wrapping up. Indra, thank you again for this amazing conversation.",
It has had a huge impact on me. And getting to know you through your book is definitely one of the highlights for me.,
"I'm so grateful for that. And in true Oprah Winfrey style, if you're OK with it,",
"I'd like to maybe end with one last question. And that is, what is one thing you know for sure?",
The one thing I know for sure is that women represent the single biggest opportunity,
in our country for growth. For elevating this country's economic growth in every,
"which way, women represent the single biggest opportunity. Somebody said women are the single biggest emerging",
opportunity in the country. I firmly believe that. And I think the time has come to unleash,
the potential of this incredible group of people that we call women.,
"Fantastic. Well, thank you. Thanks again for being here. Thank you for the inspiration. Thank you for the advice and the very direct communication",
"style.     Thank you, Lilah. It was a pleasure and a privilege chatting with you.",
Thank you.      You're welcome.,
Introduction,
good uh good morning good afternoon hello Googlers around the world watching,
this I'm Alan Davidson senior policy counsel for the company your man in Washington where I head up the,
Washington public policy operation for the company and I'm delighted to be here today to introduce our guest today thank,
you for all for joining us and just for the record this is not another,
installment of the candidates at Google forum although if our guests would like,
to make some news today we'd be delighted to hear it in the meantime I think we can just content ourselves with,
having one of the country's leaders in industry technology and public policy and politics here with us today so I'm,
honored to introduce the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg who as many of you know but is not only one of our,
country's political leaders but also an industry leader he is a before entering,
his claim to fame I should say here at Google actually comes from probably his work before entering politics before,
becoming mayor he in 1981 started Bloomberg LP from scratch and it has,
become one of the most successful media companies on the planet the company has grown to be an essential information,
resource for anyone involved in a financial sector what many of you may not know is that Mayor Bloomberg is also,
what some have described as a geek at heart he has a degree in electrical,
engineering from Johns Hopkins and confessed in the in the prep room to,
actually have us having assembled one of those little like crystal radio sets when he was a child so he's got he's got,
some some geek street cred he he is,
renowned I think as mayor for having applied his technology know-how and his,
entrepreneurship and industry background to try to transform the public sector as mayor under his leadership New York City,
has a Ellucian eyes that's public school system I think it's safe to say it's created a climate an economic climate,
where companies like Google thrive and we have of course a huge presence in in New York for the company and-and-and the,
mayor has boldly pushed one of our nation's largest cities to go green it's actually very interesting,
"he has mandated new emission and mileage standards for all 13,000 New York City",
taxicabs actually just as an example of one of these kinds of things where the city is going to have a fully hybrid,
fleet by 2012 I think probably the first city to do something for certainly for a city of that size I'd do anything with,
that kind of fleet so quite interesting I'm sure we'll be happy to answer questions about all this I'd also note,
that the the mere possibility of his candidacy for president has electrified,
pollsters and people in Washington DC and many in the public the mayor will be,
talking today with Sheryl Sandberg our intrepid vice president of global online,
sales who needs no introduction in this community but I'll just say as an editorial noted it's it's rare that we,
here get somebody to speak who's so experienced an accomplishment and,
accomplished in the in the worlds of both business and industry as well as,
technology and politics and public policy so please join me in welcoming Mayor Bloomberg Google,
thanks everyone for being with us this,
morning and this afternoon all over and once again a Google welcome for Mayor,
Bloomberg,
so this is our chance to get to know you both as an individual motivates you what,
Early lessons,
inspires you so it's okay we're going to start at the beginning sure you are grew up in Medford Massachusetts and you,
have publicly said that the lessons early on of hard work were very important interestingly worked through,
Hopkins as a parking attendant how would you say your upbringing or those early,
lessons have helped shape your life well I think you look at your parents and most of us are lucky enough to have,
parents not everybody does and one of our problems in New York City is we have a lot of kids we have to help who aren't,
so lucky they are raised by grandparents or aren't such as friends but I had two,
loving parents my mother's still alive 98 years old lives in the house that I grew up in flew down this weekend to New,
York went back I hope that I've inherited her genes but my father was a,
bookkeeper for a little dairy company and he went to work seven days a week right up until he checked himself into,
the hospital to die and I think you can't help but be formed by your parents,
their wet work ethic we talked about charity,
and social obligations one of the things my parents did which I had wanted to do,
with my daughter's but didn't quite get accomplished but I would urge all of you if you have kids can and do it my mother,
made sure my sister and I waited at home for my father to come for dinner we,
always ate together as a family we set the table together it was never a pot in the history of our family that came to,
the table we served everything much more formally,
and we went around the table and talked about what we did that day and so I,
remember discussing charity we'd collect for some cause in the neighborhood I was,
a boy scout and sold Christmas wreaths to raise money for a few things and my,
sister did the same kinds of things but if you look back and say who was the,
most influential in setting your life on,
the right course it was clearly in my case my parents a lot of other people,
that had something to do with it but the great challenge we have in our society is we live in a world where parents,
aren't spending the time with their children I went to visit a charter,
school two weeks ago where it's they have kindergarten and first grade next,
year they'll have K 1 & 2 and then they'll build up to K through 5 but they,
insist that the parents read half a dozen books to the children every single,
week they ask the children to write a sentence or two about each of the books they call the parents every single week,
and say did you read and if the parents didn't have time they say well you're going to have to remove your kid from,
school unless you start doing it but how we get in this society we live in where,
everybody's got so many things to do and families are much more fluid than,
they've ever been before how we get to have the parents really spend time one-on-one with their children is one of,
our great challenges and I think that's the challenge in our school system as well we talk about numbers,
talk about methods of teaching in the end education particularly at the lower level is a teacher looking a single,
student in the eye dialoguing understanding what that student needs answering questions and,
this is just too little of that in our competitive fun society so with your,
First setback,
parents and upbringing you had probably your first setback which you write about,
in your book as I read was at Salman after Salman was but well I got fired at,
15 years I'll let him say that people always are afraid to say that I was nice and I can just tell you what should,
happen to everyone of it best thing that ever happened to me and of all the,
people on the executive committee that fired me sadly one is no longer alive he,
died in an airplane crash but the other six are all paying customers so in the,
end thank you very much no I was at Tulare don't fire any of us right all,
right I was at Salomon Brothers for 15 16 years it was a phenomenal experience,
I look forward to going in every day I've always looked forward to going in every day even the day there I knew I,
was going to get fired but I've looked forward to going into my company for 20,
years City Hall now for the last five and a half years I've always believed that tomorrow is going to be even better,
than today and as long as you and your family get up in the morning how can it be a bad day but at Salomon Brothers,
they gave me a chance to grow I had setbacks I had successes and when we,
sold the company it was time for me to leave anyways I thought they were changing the company in a ways that I,
didn't think was the best ways to do it I'd had expressed myself I don't think they needed me around I talked about,
leaving a year before they said oh stick around for another year and when we sold the company when I sat down with the the,
head of the company it was time I said to go and they said yes time to go and I,
we didn't have severance in those days that was a more modern-day concept but I did have my share,
of the value of the company which we were selling at the time and that was the nest egg that I used to start my,
company and I was with that for 20 years and it was time to fire myself and the,
ways to do that was run for mayor why I did it so Bloomberg the company you started,
Bloomberg,
that bears her name is about information the early vision was providing information to people and that's,
obviously something very close to our hearts at Google and as you said as we were walking around with our founders,
these are the days before the Internet it was before the internet and it was before pcs if you wanted to get online,
and share data digitally you actually shared it in an analogue sense because,
the computers with 300 baud acoustically coupled computers you plugged the phone,
set in and maybe would you know after half an hour you could get a couple of,
pages of information out so I hired an engineer guy from Dartmouth where my,
girlfriend went Ron Harris and we designed our own PC and we built the,
keyboard and had a company in Coeur d'Alene Idaho I think builded all the keyboard manufacturers used to be in one,
place we made the PC boards I helped solder occasionally we bought chassis,
zand monitors and then when it came to installation I would get out at night or,
on weekends and we crawl unto desks installing the the cabling I'm glad,
local 3 didn't catch us in those days or the fire department but then and and the,
internet as you pointed out didn't exist then so what we did is we rented high-speed lines which I think were 9600,
baud lines in those days out to the major cities and then rented some space,
in each city where we had lines going out at 4800 bought to the customer sites,
and then of course later on along came the internet so we could get rid of all,
of that along came the PC and we converted over to that and we,
basically got out of the hardware and telecommunications business and that let,
us focus on what was unique about the company people always call this a technology company and I never thought,
that was really a good description it was gathering information and categorizing the information and giving,
people software that they can could turn that information into useful tools in,
their decision-making so analytics as well as search and that kind of stuff but that was what was unique about,
Bloomberg but people always talked about it in context of hardware and communications it's an incredible story,
Pricing,
and it's been an incredible business so Google we give our information for free but Bloomberg does not Bloomberg is,
expensive it's something like Bloomberg is very inexpensive given the value added thank you very much no but it's,
"something that's more my daughters have to eat so something like $1,500 per",
"person per month and in a famous story I'm head of well-known money management firm offered his employees $15,000 cash",
if they'd give up their Bloomberg's and 11 of the 12 said no right away and the 12th I think said no like a week later,
which is the best test you could have of the value of that information what do you think makes that information so,
valuable to your customers and why do you think that has continued through what is you know a 20 plus your rise of,
a company well it's all public information or its proprietary to the company that they share within their,
company but we don't have any secrets we don't know where stock prices are going to be next week that's not what we're,
selling we're selling information about companies or about historical prices of,
equities or debt securities and the more complex the world gets in the financial,
world the better our business will be because you really do need to have technology to or have software to,
analyze what things you own and what the risks are I think that what we've done,
that's unique is we collect it we have people all over the world collecting at,
"local sites because it's just too hard to collect formation from 5,000 miles away",
particularly if it's in another language with customs and conventions and,
terminology that is unique to that place we categorize the information one of the,
big problems is that a deputy earnings for example has very many different,
different definitions around the world and if you want to compare a company let's say that is based in the UK versus,
one that's based in the US versus one that's based in Sri Lanka earnings means,
three different things and you have to be able to have a ways to put them on a comparable basis so it's that kind of,
stuff there's a quality control that I think others find very difficult to do,
we focus on checking data and again and,
again and again so that you can be reasonably sure I can't guarantee you with the you know trillions of pieces of,
information we have that everything is exactly accurate but clearly we would have an error rate much lower than,
anybody else has that's why people are willing to depend on the data they have,
to depend on something and they'll go to the place that's most reliable and in terms of the cost you know if you make,
people more efficient then the cost is can only be viewed in that context so we,
once had customer who wanted a volume discount and I explained to the customer,
that the largest collector of revenue in the world has a volume premium and that,
they were lucky I didn't Institute that that happens to be the IRS for those who didn't figure it out um so a lots been,
Culture,
written about the culture of Bloomberg and as I've walked around the New York office your headquarters looks a little,
like Google or maybe we look a little like you do since we came later but open office space which I know you've brought,
to the City Hall and your mayor's work lots of free food we didn't invent it but we have it too what do you think has,
mattered about the culture of Bloomberg and what lessons do you think a company like this should learn I think it's not,
just the companies I think it's the government's and everybody else people want recognition and respect and whether you do it by giving,
them free food and nice offices whether you do it by always giving them the,
credit when somebody says why does it go on I always make a point when I walk into a building I shake the hands of the,
security people at the door if it wasn't for them the rest of us wouldn't be able to go in and conduct our business,
they're just as important as the head of the company I think we have too many distinctions,
between people and the egalitarian concept that America was built around I,
think really works and it's at Bloomberg,
I abolished all titles there's no titles in the company on my card it never said,
anything it just said Michael Bloomberg and address and phone number and in those days you need to have email addresses today they continue with that,
process everybody knows who they work for there is a hierarchy actually you,
have to have a hierarchy after that structure but that doesn't mean that we should have every time we introduce,
somebody something that distinguishes and has says that one person is more,
important than the other in city government you can't quite do that because they've built into that the,
structure is is different in the requirements that use titles is different but in the private sector to,
the extent that you can include everybody in this room and around the world that works for Google I would argue do it that's what we do at,
Bloomberg it's the extent that you can make people be happy and to come to work,
and want to be there in the end lot plays a very important part and how successful you are but the harder you,
work and the longer you work the luckier you're going to be so you want people to want to come in early in the morning and,
want to stay late you want people that if they want to take some time off for family obligations that's fine but you,
want them to want to come back and I think if you take a look you're never,
"going to please everybody Bloomberg has about 9,500 employees maybe 120 offices",
around the and they'll always be somebody that isn't happy but fundamentally we have a very low turnover rate and I think,
whenever you have intellectual content as the basis of your business and,
certainly Google does and certainly Bloomberg does the most important asset you have of the people that leave at,
night and come in in the morning and so that's what your focus should be it's great advice so we're to turn to,
politics so for those of you watching from the New York office the mayor is planning a visit to our New York headquarters yesterday we love you and,
we want you to pay taxes in New York and in fact didn't you invite Sergey Brin to,
become a tax payer New York just family I certainly did he could his taxes would,
probably be help us with our budget he noted that his wife likes New York but,
it's expensive to pay taxes in New York but he's happy to visit and use your services for free so so in New York you,
New York,
ran for mayor 2001 widely contested election and then was you were reelected in 2005 which what by all accounts was,
the broadest and most diverse alliance behind one person that a city like New York or any City had ever seen obviously,
huge success on business practices brought to City Hall the 3-1-1 number which I'm hoping you'll talk about and,
why that's work as I think you're about to take your 50 millionth call how do you explain what you've done in New York,
and the impact it's had for the citizens of that city well I have nine hundred,
and twenty-seven days left to go but who's counting I'm term-limited out so I'm not going to,
serve longer than that but I do plan to serve all of those nine hundred and twenty seven days and then when I leave it'll be like a good vacation with,
somebody once said you loved every minute of it but you're glad to get home and I will have had eight years of,
public service I can look my daughters in the eye and say your father devoted some of his life to making this world a,
better world and my next career will be in philanthropy I done the business thing I've done the government thing and,
I'm looking forward to spending some time focusing on public health issues,
and education and government policy those are the kinds of things the arts a little bit those are the things that I want to support,
I think in government the reason our administration has been successful first,
and foremost is I did something that unfortunately probably is if not unique,
is rare and that is looking at picking the best people for the job regardless,
of what party affiliation they have regardless of whether they supported me,
when I was running for re-election or not regardless of one woman I've ever,
applied for a job she didn't get it but not because of this she was very proud she was a member of the Communist Party,
and I thought it'd be great to have her in the administration and give the press something to write about but she didn't,
make the cut for a variety of other reasons but we have gone as a guy Nevin,
Thal who had been the deputy mayor during one of my predecessors administration's head Koch's and he ran,
the group that interviewed people and came up with suggestions and I would be,
with a small group interview let's say the last three contestants for any one job but if our administration's success,
that Leventhal really deserves as much credit as anybody else because we put together a team that I think safe to say,
is better than any other administration has ever had we've had virtually no scandals we've had virtually no turnover,
and it's hard to find fault with any of the agencies in New York City you got to,
understand the city is a big business it has three hundred thousand employees it has a 59 billion dollar budget,
it has 8.2 million customers we deal with life and death issues as well as,
things that will have impact on society going way down the road so there's a,
real responsibility there and the seven deputy mayor's I have and the roughly 40,
commissioners really in every single case I think most people would agree with me there's never been a better they,
may have been one that's as good but there's never been a better person in that job and we in modern history and,
I'm a big delegator in terms of management style if you're going to run a 20 24 7 organization you have to do,
that anybody that tries to centralize everything through themselves or through their staff really is making a terrible,
mistake but that's why lots of businesses don't work and once why lots of governments don't work because they do exactly that,
I set the ethics I focus on making sure,
that the agencies work together focus on allocation of resources to each one but,
when it comes down to the day in and day out nuts and bolts of the organization I want them to keep the city hall deputy,
mayor's posted as to what they're going to do if there's going to be something controversial they certainly should,
notify them in advance so we don't get blindsided but fundamentally it's not going to keep them from being able to do,
it my basic management philosophy is that I will ride with a manager as long as I,
think that manager is competent and hardworking and is making reasonable decisions based on the information they,
have doesn't mean the decisions that I would make but it doesn't mean my decisions would be any better so if you,
do that I think that you will be able to do a good job whether it's in a company,
or in a government in this government in New York City the public has recognized,
it and I think basically does think that we are doing a good job when I first came into office in 2002 the city had a,
budget deficit partially because of 9/11 partially because of a downturn and Wall,
Street and the economy after the end of the internet bubble it really started to decline the economy in our tax base in,
the middle of 2001 before 9/11 and the,
city got in trouble its revenues were less than than its expenses by four five,
six billion dollars depending on which year you talked about the city's finances are expenses that,
you have little control over at least unless the world comes to an end you have little control over them they're,
pretty fixed with some inflation built in and the revenues are very variable,
now no company would run its business that way and a company you'd try to match your revenues to expenses in,
government it doesn't work that way you can't go out of product lines in government and in fact the very time,
your revenues start to decline the demands to provide services go up so it,
exacerbates the problem that you have when I had to make the tough choices of,
stopping hiring and even laying off a handful of people of telling every,
agency they had to do more with less something that is never done in government when I had to go before the,
tax payers and say look we're raising taxes plain and simple we can't have it both ways we can't have police that are,
going to bring crime down and teachers they're going to improve education and firefighters they're going to show up,
when you have an emergency if we don't pay them and the mistake that the city made back in the 70s was they cut back,
services well if we want to keep people on tax base in the city we've got to make it a more attractive place to live,
and work and go to school and get medical care than anyplace else so at that time my popularity went from,
I guess just over 50% when I got elected down to 25-30 percent in one year I,
closed a bunch of fire houses that we didn't need I didn't cut back the number of firefighters quite the contrary I,
increased the number of firefighters because we'd lost a lot of to 343,
firefighters but also a lot of experience on 911 and I had to keep the city safe so I authorized that one,
agency to even get bigger but it was not popular closing fire houses I raised the,
property taxes as I said and in the same year I put a smoking ban in and I always,
joke if you can do a parade going by a bunch of bars on Staten Island after that you can do anything,
today when I do a parade on Staten Island going by a bar even the people are still smoking outside they wave the,
cigarette so that yeah I know I shouldn't I know I said we love you but I've always been a believer that the,
Public Opinion,
public is much smarter than anybody gives them credit for they get,
conflicting views so it takes a little while to make judgments as to who they,
trust and who they don't sometimes they do things based on instinct but their,
instinct after a while gets becomes a very good instinct and over the years,
the public has come to think that it's not me it's the administration but you,
know today you have 75 80 % depending on which group you measure it approval and that will last only until my next,
smoking ban maybe no I think that from now on it the administration will stay,
popular because people even when they didn't like what we were doing even when our approvals were down the question is,
the mayor honest and does he care always got 75 odd percent approval rating and if you have that the other just will,
come and go with the issue or with a temper of the times but that's the most important thing and the city that I'm,
"lucky enough to be working with because of the 300,000 people that work there and all of the management really has I",
think a bright future we have problems we have risks so does everybody else but it's a great place to live our,
populations at an all-time high we've added more people in the last half a dozen years than a live in Pittsburgh,
we're building a public affordable housing for more people that live in Atlanta we have more kids in our public,
school system than people that live in Detroit you know the numbers for New York are so big and so staggering that's,
one of the reasons I've always thought I have the greatest job in the world because not only can you do something in,
the city the city is a bellwether for what happens around the world that really is a leader if you can get things,
done there than other cities try to follow and even states and countries as they did with the smoking ban,
so it's a nice segue one of the areas you've really led which certainly fits,
Second Amendment,
your description of an area where Americans have conflicting view is gun control emotions run very strongly on,
both sides and you've really stepped up as a leader not just as a mayor of New York but but nationally can you talk a,
little bit about what your views are on the Second Amendment and what you think is important for the United States going forward in this area,
well I've deliberately tried to pick a course where I think we can make some,
progress and not address issues away from that the Constitution and the Bill,
of Rights gives you the right to bear arms and if you ask me should we have a,
constitutional convention to change any part of the Constitution I would argue no because you couldn't control what,
things we'd change and I'd rather live with a document that we have that's basically stood us in good stead rather,
than go and open it up where I think unfortunately a lot of things that protect us might be taken away so I've,
not addressed the Second Amendment right to bear arms and also we have in this country a system where every state can,
set their own gun laws in New York State I'm happy to say and our administration,
had a little bit of say in it the state legislature passed the toughest gun control law in the country and it has to,
do with people who carry illegal or carry guns illegally and if you get,
convicted of carrying a gun that you don't have a permit for you automatically go to the slammer for,
three and a half to five years you got to be careful and make sure that the,
district attorneys don't accept a plea for something different a lot of these laws that get passed don't really work,
out the ways you would think they would but our hope is that we will enforce,
this law and that that will give a disincentive to people to carry guns with the issue that I've tried to,
address is that there's a federal law that says you can't sell a gun to a,
criminal somebody with a criminal record and the NRA always says we don't need more,
laws just enforce the ones that you have on the books pointing to New York and I,
say I'm a hundred percent in agreement with you we should enforce the laws but we have to enforce the federal laws as,
well as the state laws in New York City we brought down the number of guns we brought down crime rate murder rate is,
down again this year it's going up sadly in the rest of the country but we'll have a record year I think in terms of,
record low if you take a look at the FBI statistics every six months they put out,
a list of all cities with a hundred thousand population or more this past,
"year the second half of six there were two hundred forty four cities in population 100,000 or more we were the",
15th safest city out of the 214 per capita and the 14 cities that were safer,
there were a handful whose names I didn't even recognize much less know where they were so New York really is,
dramatically safer than virtually any other place and you can see that in record tourism and an record number of,
kids from getting out of schools around the country wanting to come and teach in our public school system and that sort,
of thing but at the federal level there is this law that says gun dealers can't sell to known criminals and yet when we,
arrest somebody for committing a crime invariably they have a gun that they,
possess illegally and if you trace where that gun came from remember there's a,
serial number on the gun you can trace it back you find that 1% of the gun,
dealers in this country sell something like 65% of the illegal guns and in fact,
in New York 80 odd percent of the guns that we recover when we arrest somebody,
come from out of state so it's a federal issue it's directed at a very small,
number of gun dealers it does not address states rights to have permits or,
not have permits or let you carry a gun whatever I did get a little bit of trouble I thought the stupidest thing,
I've ever heard my whole life there was editorial written in a paper which said,
Virginia Tech could have been prevented if they'd armed all the students you,
know you wonder who what was going I don't know what they were smoking when they wrote that but it certainly wasn't,
it certainly wasn't a Marlboro what we,
Gun Trace Data,
did is we put together a coalition of 225 mayor's from the East Coast the West,
Coast north-south republican democrat independence big city small city and with the one objective of getting,
together to change a law in Congress which for the last three years has prevented gun police from sharing data,
about this trace data as to where guns came from where who sold them it's an,
outrage it protects criminals it doesn't hurt anybody's right to bear arms or,
become a hunter or whatever else you want to do this just plain and simple in a post-911 world is a law that says,
police officers can't share information and the NRA says oh that's not true they,
can under the circumstances that circumstance but the bottom line is I'm right they can't share information in a,
usable sense and my hope is that we can convince Congress to not include this as,
a rider on the appropriation bill see it's um it's something that would never stand the light of day in Congress,
nobody have a vote for it it's so clearly Pro criminal but as a rider an,
appropriation bill what Congress says is oh I didn't know I didn't vote for that I voted for monies for your schools,
monies for the elderly monies for anything that tears your hearts pulls your heartstrings and it just so happens,
that that was there and I couldn't keep it from being part of it well I've said to the leadership this is not a,
Republican or Democratic issue it's not a Senate or House thing is both both and you've got to keep this amendment off,
the appropriations bill this year I've lobbied Nancy Pelosi who comes from San,
Francisco and very powerful on the house side Barbara Mikulski the,
senator from Maryland where I went to school and somebody that I've supported over the years she happens to head a,
subcommittee that would could keep it off the Senate version but Congress works in strange ways neither bill can,
have it on it and then go into conference and outcomes with that there so that's what we've got to protect and,
we've not been reticent about expressing our views we've given speeches we've had,
Congress conferences we even made a TV ad where the Chief of Police of the,
small town in the Minnesota talks about how it has inhibited his ability to do,
his job and we ran it in the districts of on television of a couple of the,
people who support this amendment that was fascinating the guy who's the author,
of the amendment called me up screaming you know how dare you and what would you do if they ran ads against you on,
television in New York I pointed out to him I have the police the fire the teachers all do the same thing against,
me so why not welcome to the real world but anyways it really is a very big,
thing I do not happen to personally think that you should be allowed to,
carry even legal guns in big cities like New York City I guess I don't have a problem if you carry them in an urban,
area although crime is a problem for not just cities it's a crime for suburban and,
urban areas throughout this country there are roughly the same number of people that get murdered with illegal,
guns every day in our country as we're killed at Virginia Tech and if you think,
about the press and the focus on the tragedy of Virginia Tech and you say,
wait a second there's one every day in America and Virginia Tech got the publicity but nothing else does there,
also if I remember the numbers a couple of people that get killed accidentally,
with guns every day in this country and they're about 46 people I think it is that commit suicide with guns every day,
says about 80 people that die from a gun not all illegal guns but 80 people that,
die from guns every day that's a 911 a month and nobody seems to try to want to do anything about it so I'm going to ask,
Running for President,
you one last question and open it up to questions from our audience so I'm not gonna ask you if you're running for president you just clearly said you're,
going to stay through the end of New York you're on the cover of Time this morning so if you were going to announce it you might have done it but I'll ask,
you this instead if someone works for you and you promise you won't tell anybody exactly uh tell me Alan time,
let's say someone like you were to enter the 2008 race someone who would likely run as a named defendant had the ability,
to self-finance you agency way together if someone like you were to enter I think we're all curious when do you,
think that decision would be made what do you think that person might learn,
from the Perot candidacy and what kind of impact do you think it would have on the 2008 race our hypothetical candidate,
not you who was Ross Perot oh yeah exactly look I'm not a candidate for,
president we have 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats last time they had these,
debates which I find fascinating because they have absolutely nothing to do with the job in the qualifications and they,
don't tell you anything about whether or not any of those candidates would be good or bad presidents what they really,
say is did they memorize their notes of what to say if and whether their staff was able to anticipate and you know it's,
a it is that if you look at both in both debates they pandered that what I would,
argue the same ways but let me talk about the country because it's whoever out of those 20 becomes president United,
States has to do something about a country that I think is really in,
trouble we are in trouble overseas is obviously unpopular war but a war,
that has no easy answers the people that say let's just automatically pull troops,
out I don't think have really looked at the consequences of destabilizing the world and the genocide that may or may,
not occur depending on who you believe we ask our young men and women overseas while we're sitting here they are,
fighting and dying for us I'll take a great story I gave a commencement speech at Bard College in,
upstate New York which is a very very liberal College they think Trotsky was a,
capitalist and about a third of them had signs on the back of their gowns troops,
out of Iraq and during my commencement speech I said it was Memorial Day weekend I said you know I'm not,
unmindful of seeing the signs but just remember that young men and women are,
overseas fighting and dying and have been for 235 years so that you have the right to protest which you don't have in,
many other places anyways there's the war there is our relationships around the world our reputation has been hurt,
very badly in in the last few years we are we've had a go at alone mentality in,
a world where because of communications intelligent and transportation you,
should be going exactly in the other direction there's no one country that can stand on its own anymore we're so,
interconnected through trade and everything else the country I don't know that we've fulfilled our,
responsibilities to stop genocide and protect freedom elsewhere around the world we have an immigration policy at,
the border just people coming in here which dissuades people from coming here and there's an outgrowth of 9/11 we,
aren't trying to get attract and keep the people that we really need to take,
this country forward we have an anti-immigration policy that is disgrace,
this country needs half a million immigrants every year if we're going to have a future we need doctors and,
lawyers and Indian chiefs we need people who are going to contribute sweat capital and intellectual capital we need,
people from every country around the world that's always been the great strength of America and we need to to do,
that and we need to recognize that we're not going to deport 12 million people who are already here let's get serious,
we don't have an army big enough to do that it would be devastating to our economy would be the biggest mass,
deportation of people in the history of the world and something America should not even joke about much less seriously,
contemplate hopefully Congress will something about that we have domestic,
problems who's going to pay for your Social Security who's going to pay for health care I'm giving a speech tomorrow,
on paralysis in Washington brought about by partisanship and one of the things I point out we all talk about health care,
and it's one of these issues that I'm sure the debates which I haven't seen either Republican or Democratic debates,
but health care has got to be one of the issues everybody's in favor of health care nobody wants to address the fact,
that we spend 50% more on health care in this country than they do in Western,
Europe yet our life expectancy is about four years lower nobody wants to address,
the fact that there are sixteen percent of our population that doesn't have health care doesn't have insurance but,
some of them do get health care particularly in New York where our public hospitals will treat anybody in,
our public hospitals in New York City we've sunk an enormous amount of money in in the last five years and they get,
rated they get accredited at the same level at our great teaching hospitals do so you really do get great care in New,
York City this is the people interestingly enough who don't have insurance seem to have a life expectancy,
of no worse than the people that do have insurance so maybe we're not looking at,
the right thing maybe we're not looking at the quality of health care one of the mistakes we make is we don't focus on,
preventive health care we focus on reactive kinds of health care after you get sick then we're willing to do,
something and we have the best technology and the best health care in the world after you get sick if in Europe you,
could die before you get your open-heart surgery if you need it but the likelihood of you needing open-heart,
surgery is a lot less in Europe because they work on preventive things trying to,
focus on smoking and diet and exercise and regular check-ups and those kinds of,
things so you know you can go down public education you want to fix the societal problems that we have by doing,
one thing improve public education that will go more towards ameliorating or eliminating most of our problems and yet,
I don't hear anybody standing up at a national level in all fairness to Bush No Child Left Behind,
starts to try to do it it's not the perfect law and it can be improved but at least you got to give the president,
credit for trying to focus on that but nevertheless I don't see anybody being,
willing to stand up and say we have to put accountability into schools and we have to pay our teachers a fair rate but,
we also have to demand that they do teach and that the students learn or that they suffer the consequences that,
you would suffer in the private sector if you didn't do the job that you were hired to do we have crime street crime,
as I said before it's going down in New York but it's going up in the rest of the country you have a much greater,
chance of being killed on the streets of our city then from a street crime than,
you do from terrorism and yet every press conferences they all beat their,
chests and say I can protect this country better from terrorists well what about protecting them out in the streets,
every day there is scary in this country,
it's probably because of our bad education system but the percentage of people that believe in creationism is,
really scary for for a country that's going to have to compete in a world where science and medicine require a,
better understanding and you as a citizen are going to have to make more informed choices you're going to have,
more choice and the consequences of those choices are going to be better so I think the country is in trouble I,
think it's they're not yeah I don't think you can blame either party I don't think you can blame 1600 Pennsylvania,
Avenue or Congress I think they've all done this together there is a partisanship that friends of mine who've,
been in government for a long time say is much worse than it used to be I'm not sure that my mother always says the good,
old days weren't the good old days but there is some evidence that because you,
have a roughly even divide in this country both parties are unwilling to run any risks and to provide leadership,
now I've always been a believer the reason our administration has been successful is we've been willing to take,
on some of those controversial issues to me leadership is leading from the front,
not the back my way I think it works is people elect the executive,
to do what they think is right and you don't have a litmus test of where you stand on this that or the other issue,
you want somebody that's smart and hardworking and honest and creative and,
can be a leader and if we don't do that then then we're in trouble you know,
America has come up with great leaders over throughout history sometimes taken a crisis to get there my only focus is,
for the next 927 days to make sure in that New York has it and I'll do the best I can it will make all the right,
decisions I'm trying to institute a whole series we have a hundred 27 ideas,
on how to improve the environment that we live in it does we'll do our part for,
stopping global warming or at least slowing it down but the main thing I've got to worry about is the air that our,
children are breathing today we have places in our city where kids go to the hospital with asthma attacks at four,
times the national average I've got to do something to get the trucks that drive through their neighborhoods off,
the streets and so we have a variety of schemes one is to barge our solid waste,
out of the city or take it on a rail rather than truck one is to which we're,
fighting a battle hopefully I can get the state legislature to go along with charging a fee a congestion pricing fee,
is what it's called and they do it in London and Singapore to encourage,
discards into Manhattan where the density is so high and at the same time,
use the fees to improve mass transit I tried to take the subway every day to work partially to set an example for,
people but also it happens to be the best way to get to work so do you take your subway here,
we have on just shuttles good buses that you can wire listen one of your found is,
bicycle here today deserves a lot of credit absolute so we've got to keep the mayor on time but we'll take just a,
Education,
couple of questions from the audience so the first couple people who can get to the mics will take your questions,
probably just a German is just probably two or three so go ahead your first,
thanks for joining us here in Mountain View think about having me I'm actually a recent transplant from New York and,
before I joined Google I was working at the New York City Department of Education with Joel Klein and when I,
started you had just taken control of the department and gone through the process of sort of dismantling the,
existing school structure from districts into regions and now there is this plan to break out the regions into a,
different formation and one of the tensions that was always sort of felt in the Department of Ed is this question of,
stabilizing such a large school system and pushing it forward I suspect that's something that you encounter not just an,
education but anything else so could you comment on how you see the tensions,
between you know really pushing for big changes on the scale that's necessary for a department like New City and sort,
of stabilizing a million school children and all the different groups that have,
interests well let me jump to the end the results because then you can,
question but we could have done it better but at least you know whether we did it okay our graduation rates for,
high school students in four years is up roughly twenty percent in the last four years the math scores and reading scores,
are up roughly the same amount the gap between how black and Latino kids test,
and white and Asian kids test has started to close quite dramatically as a matter of fact the math scores that just,
came out last week of the week before showed black and Latino kids improving at double the rate of white and Asian,
kids and we've always had this two-tiered system which is intolerable in our country and if you want to fix,
"society you've got to focus on that so I think that crime is down in the schools we had 70,000 applicants for 5,000",
"jobs last year when I came into office we couldn't fill the 12,000 people that",
were leavings physicians every year so we're probably doing okay when I came in you had this enormous,
bureaucracy that didn't exist for the kids the whole system was focused on,
they use the kids as a prop you'd never do a press conference without having your obligatory kid brought in from,
central casting and as a matter of fact that they young you can hold them but what what I had to do is the,
headquarters of the Department of Education Board of Education was across the river in Brooklyn that's only a,
building infamously known as one ten Livingston Street I threw Joel Klein our,
Chancellor we called up we took the 32 managers told them they could bring a couple of people we brought them across,
the river and then sold the building and so you know you may try to put it back,
after I go but that buildings now apartments are being converted into apartments and I put them into a,
building that's right next to City Hall and did the same thing open-plan including the Chancellor who sits at a,
cubicle just like I do and I think that has encouraged more communications and more teamwork and less fighting why at,
the beginning go and get rid of some of the bureaucracy and then you can argue putting it back I don't think we've done,
that I think what we've done is we've gotten rid of that bureaucracy we put a few hundred million dollars more into,
the classroom by having a lot fewer bureaucrats and the school system today,
is fundamentally different than it was when we took it over through the leadership academy we've probably replaced half of the principal's so you,
have much better management and it would be great if you had a system principals,
and teachers at every school where they could tailor the educational process to,
the constituency that they have to work with to their students some places that's not possible you don't have the,
management or the teachers someplace it's just such a challenge that nobody can do it yet maybe someday we'll get,
there but we've tried to address issues this year coming September for the first time all schools will get roughly the,
same amount per capita in their budgets we always had the wealthy schools kept,
getting wealthier because they got more money per capita than the poor schools why because in the wealthy neighborhoods,
they know how to address the government and demand something and hold the elected officials feet to the fire and,
say if you don't give it to us we're not going to support you poor communities don't know how to do that so you know we,
always removing government is different than business in government you move resources from things that work to,
things that don't in business you move them with things that don't do things that do and it's because of exactly that,
phenomenon so we're going in the direction of letting the principal and teachers run their own school with their,
own budget the principal can decide do I want more teachers or more test tubes and books or whatever and try to get at,
that level not every teacher not every principal because not all of them are capable of doing it and as I say there,
are some schools that have special needs and the kids that we you know we have a system that's so big that every problem,
magical in the world that the parents of our schoolchildren speak a hundred and seventy different languages and while No,
Child Left Behind requires you to have books and every one of those languages some of those language is done of a,
written language so what you do I don't know but it is going in the right direction and I think if we can keep that going,
for the next two or three years until I'm out of office hopefully the public will say I like good schools and the mayor has shown,
that you can do it and I hope my successor will be a better mayor than I,
am and to take things to an even greater level that would be the most the,
greatest compliment that that we could have it and I'm going to live in the city for the rest of my life so I want that to happen thank you next question,
Affordable Housing,
you've made affordable housing a priority for your administration but most of your initiatives have been for,
outside of Manhattan housing outside of Manhattan and do you think that middle and lower-income New Yorkers should be,
able to live in that and if so why haven't you supported programs in the legislature like in,
jalan mo bills okay let me come back to mitchell-lama because it's a separate thing but keep in mind we have done a,
lot in Manhattan it's just Manhattan doesn't have the open land if you're going to build new spaces you've got a,
fine land and one of the things in our environmental plan is to clean up brownfields New York is fundamentally different than other cities,
there's no vacant land there are no abandoned buildings so you have to be really creative in finding where to do,
it so if you want to go and take down some buildings and build a skyscraper we'll give you the zoning permission to,
do it but you've got to agree to include some low income and affordable housing and a whole balance a whole smorgasbord,
of different alternatives for people to live together and one of the things that's different about New York City,
then other cities is you can in one block see all different kinds of housing,
for all different economic levels it's not structured the way of the cities are with is this kind of neighborhood and,
that kind of neighborhood even ethnicities mix much more than you would have thought or that they used to in New,
York City in terms of mitchell-lama that's a housing program where developers were given a program where,
they got in they got a tax break in return for freezing rents or agreeing to,
a moderate increase in rents for the next 30 years the 30 years has come up,
and yet we made a deal so we're going to have to live with that deal but we have a follow-on program which is encouraging,
a lot of them and I think most will take a similar deal going forward,
remember the tenants in mitchell-lama want to buy their apartments they're fundamentally not on the side you would,
think they are it's some activists are but the people that live in mitchell-lama houses they would make a,
fortune on buying their apartment in a day and age where we don't have enough housing so it's a balance we want to,
make sure this housing for people that built the city we also want to make sure there's money for,
you know Google millionaires we're going to pay a lot of taxes that's our tax base that's where the money comes from,
so it's that balancing act and you'd be shocked if you'd come back to New York,
now neighborhoods that you'd never heard of or we'd never think of living today our hot neighborhoods my Spanish,
instructor who I'd take a lesson from every day I'll never learn to speak Spanish been working at it he moved from,
Astoria into the Upper East Side because he couldn't afford the rents in a story anymore I live in the low-rent district,
yes sir you mentioned the problems of polarization in Washington I was curious,
You Do 8 Movement,
what your thoughts were on the you do 8 movement which looks to bring back the moderate voice and constructive,
political dialogue back to America well I'm not going to get involved in analyzing the the political landscape,
but I let me just say this I think it's an interesting idea and I think it exists because there are people that are,
not satisfied with the way the two-party system is facing the country's issues,
whether people really want a third party or another alternative you know somebody else is much better qualified than I to,
gameplay that but I think that is just a symbol of frustration that they a lot of,
people think the country's not going in the right direction let me also caution you that there are no simple problems simple answers to,
complex problems if they were we probably would have solved them and what,
you think is right somebody else thinks is wrong so in a democracy achieving unanimity is not exactly doing what you,
think should be done quite the contrary you won't get a hundred percent of what you want if it's,
a real democracy unless you happen to be that one person at the top of the bell curve so yes sir so sorry with apologies,
we're getting the big we must end note we're going to give you the honor of the last question so make it a good one all,
Public Access to Information,
right thank you very much so I'm a member of the Google Earth team and as such we often find ourselves engaged in,
the debate about public access to information and I notice that you recently weighed in against Assemblyman Gian Aras I was just,
wondering if you could expand a little bit on your thoughts about the balance between public access to information and,
the government's need to at times limit access the information well Jen RS I had,
a discussion with about coned not about anything else but let me just say this I,
think the those people that say that our,
right to privacy is being eroded happened to be right but that's the,
price you pay for the advantage of having access to information you really,
can't have we can we can structure some things to have it both ways we can put limitations but we live in a world where,
we want the great benefits of technology and free information flow and that is,
something different than what we had before and so you know I think society,
votes with its feet every day to go in the direction of having more information,
available to more people I don't think the government should be in your bedroom,
or in your bathroom on the other hand we do have a legitimate interest in making,
sure that we can stop terrorism in this country and that's a very fine line we,
want our police to both protect us protect our civil rights but also keep crime down and find out where the bad,
guys are we have a law that says you your cell phone is going to constantly,
report where you are most people don't understand that but if you get sick and we have to in call 9-1-1 we want to know,
where to send the ambulance society's made that decision and the legislators have voted to take away your right to,
privacy arguably of not known not having anybody know where you are in return for,
we have security cameras in every store every office building every apartment,
building the traffic departments have them so that they can tell you where the traffic is the police have them so they,
can in some cities they have cam that are activated by the noise of gunfire we're using technology to try to,
make our lives better and safer but at the same time there's no question that more people can see what you're doing,
and that's a struggle that I think is a very healthy one it should be fought out in the courts it should be fought out in,
the public arena but the basic direction,
that we're going in is clearly more information available to more people,
because we like the benefits of having that available and if you look from Google at my backyard I didn't see me,
sunning myself you know I have occurred to me you might be looking but I guess,
I've got to get used to that you know Schwarzenegger without a top on,
and probably be more interesting but nevertheless anyways that's it you know that this is clearly a societal problem,
you're in the information business my company's in the inflammation business but we shouldn't forget that our right,
to privacy is one of the fundamental rights that we have in this country and,
how we protect that at the same time doing the others is something we should,
do with great care so if Thanks to everyone for joining us today and please join me in thanking the,
mayor for his son,
Thank you. Hi. I guess we get to spend an hour or so together today.,
Why the world needs another computer company,
"And most of the time, I wanted to spend just talking about what you want to talk and answering some questions. But I thought if you wanted, I'd take about 10 minutes or 15",
minutes upfront and tell you what we're doing at NeXT and why the world might need another computer company.,
Is that something you guys think about these things? OK.,
I thought I'd tell you about some of our mistakes. Maybe that would be more useful. We have a lot of scar tissue.,
There is a really interesting book,
that was written by a guy named Paul Strassmann. And Paul has one of the more interesting jobs in the planet.,
He's the Chief Information Officer-- CIO of a very large organization called the Pentagon.,
"And they really understand software there. I had a conversation with him not too long ago, and he said,",
the lesson from the Gulf War was that the best software will win the war. And so they're trying to do a lot of work,
"in the software area. He wrote a book, though, before he got this job called The Business Value of Computers.",
"It's rather thick, and it's not good bedtime reading. But you can plow through it, and there's some incredible stuff in it.",
"And he asked two questions in particular. One was, he surveyed a bunch of companies",
from not very successful all the way up through really successful. And there's somebody taking notes here.,
He asked how much they spent on information technology,
"as a percentage of revenues. And he got a very counter-intuitive answer, right? You'd think that either the really successful companies",
"would either spend more or less than the not-successful companies, depending on your theory. But it was exactly the same.",
"They all spent about 2% of revenues on information technology. And he found this curious, and so he asked another question.",
How did they spend their money? And he found out that the really successful ones--,
"actually, let's start with the not-so-successful ones. As success increases and dollars increase,",
"he found out that the not-so-successful ones spent the majority of their money on management productivity,",
and the more successful ones spent the majority of their money on operational productivity,
"applications. Now, this was not very pleasant for me to read, because I spent the first 10 years of my life",
"on management productivity, which was PCs. PCs and Macs never attacked operational productivity.",
They just attacked management productivity. Why is that? Because you can't go down to your local computer store,
"and buy an app that will help you do stock trading, or will help you run a hospital, or will help you",
"in whatever operational part of your business you want to automate. Unless you're a very, very small business,",
"then you can run some accounting packages. But other than that, if you were a medium-sized or large business, these things never attacked",
"operational productivity. So we zoom out and we say, how have people",
Attacking operational productivity,
"attacked operational productivity with information technology? Well, in the '60s, they bought a mainframe, and they got some terminals and a bunch of COBOL programmers,",
and they wrote a few apps. And most of them were kind of back-room apps.,
"And it sort of worked for the very few that could afford to do this. In the '70s, they got a mainframe and some terminals,",
and they did the same thing. And a few of them got a few mini computers and terminals and tried to do it a little cheaper.,
"In the '80s, nothing changed. Mainframe and terminals, minis and terminals. Until maybe about two or three years ago.",
What happened two or three years ago was that the front office started to realize that they needed operational apps so bad,
that they couldn't depend on the MIS folks anymore. They started taking life into their own hands,
and sometimes working with the MIS folks to start downsizing and getting some servers and running,
"some industry-standard databases like Sybase or Oracle in the servers, and making a little local area network,",
"and getting maybe some Sun Workstations, and spending about two years writing some mission-critical operational applications.",
"Like trading apps for Wall Street, perfect example. And it kind of worked.",
"And the reason that they needed to do this was because more and more, they were discovering",
that things like new products required a custom operational application.,
"An example, if you're in financial services and you come up with a new product, it's only three things.",
"It's an idea, it's a sales force, and it's a custom app to bang on databases",
"to make the product real, to do the mortgage swaps or whatever it is you want to do. Without the app, you don't have a product.",
And so there has been an increasing buildup of demand from the front parts of corporations,
to create more and more and more of these operational applications. And I think it's going to get to the point,
"where this becomes fairly clear that this is the next big revolution in desktop computing,",
is to attack the operational productivity. And as we start to re-engineer the way,
"we do things, to automate a lot of this in custom applications. Sounds a little strange now, to most people.",
"Sounds like desktop publishing in 1985. Nobody knew what it was, everybody thought it was kind of a strange vertical thing over there.",
But my guess is it's pretty horizontal. And we're attacking vertical markets now,
"that know they want this. And it's going extremely well. Sun is the only company that's really had any success at this,",
and we're knocking them out of the box. Because we came up with the software called NeXTSTEP which lets you build apps,
"five to 10 times faster than anything anyone's ever seen. And after you build them, they're deployable and usable",
"by mere mortals, because it's really easy to use, this computer. And you can interoperate your custom apps seamlessly",
with a bunch of off-the-shelf productivity apps. So we go to these companies that use Suns and take,
"two years to write their apps-- or are thinking about using Suns, and they can write their apps in about 90 days on a NeXT.",
"Now, if you're on Wall Street and you can create a new product in 90 days versus your competitor",
"in two years, that's eight new products you can field for their every one. And you can start to see the competitive advantage that",
"can be created this way. Now, we had no idea that we were any good at this",
when we started NeXT. A lot of times you don't know what your competitive advantage,
is when you launch a new product. Let me give you historical example.,
When we created-- how many of you guys use Macs? Anybody? Good.,
"How many of you have seen a NeXT? Oh, how many of you use a NeXT?",
"Oh, that's not so bad. We'd like to change that ratio a little bit.",
"We're on the right track. When we did the Macintosh, we never",
"anticipated desktop publishing when we created the Mac. Sounds funny, because that turned out",
"to be the Mac's compelling advantage, right? The thing that it did not one and a half or two times better",
"than everything else, but four or five times better than anything else, where you had to have one. We never anticipated it.",
"We anticipated bitmap displays and laser printers, but we never thought about page maker, that whole industry really coming down to the desktop.",
Maybe we weren't smart enough. But we were smart enough to see it start to happen,
nine to 12 months later. And we changed our entire marketing and business strategy,
"to focus on desktop publishing, and it became the Trojan horse that eventually got the Mac into corporate America,",
"where it could show its owners all the other wonderful things it could do. Likewise, when we created NeXTSTEP,",
Shrinkwrapped apps,
"this revolutionary object-oriented software that we have, our target customer",
"coming from the PC world, where shrinkwrapped apps were king, was Lotus and Adobe and WordPerfect",
and all the shrinkwrapped apps developers. And the purpose was to let them create their apps five to 10 times faster for these shrinkwrapped apps.,
"And it worked. We have a ton of shrinkwrapped apps, now. Best of breed in almost every category.",
"But it wasn't until early in '91, early last year, a little over a year ago,",
"that some really big companies came to us and said, you don't understand what you've got.",
The same software that allows Lotus to create their apps five to 10 times faster is letting us build,
our in-house mission-critical apps five to 10 times faster. And this is the biggest problem we've had.,
"This is a huge problem for every big company, and almost all medium-sized companies, and you have a solution in your hands, and you dummies don't even",
know it. And it took them about three months before we finally heard it.,
"And then last summer, we changed our whole sales and marketing strategy around to focus on that.",
"And it's taken off like a rocket. And we grew about 4x last year, and probably grow about 2x",
"this year. And our customer list is now very, very strong",
and growing like crazy. We just got back from spending a few days in DC and in New York. And we're talking to customers we only dreamed,
Competitors,
"of talking to a year ago. So that's what we do. And our arch enemy Sun, they want to kill us.",
"Which is good. They should try to do that as soon as possible, because the sooner they do it, the cheaper it",
will be for them.,
"I think it's gone past the point where it's possible. And the greatest thing is, hardware",
churns every 18 months. It's pretty impossible to get a sustainable competitive,
"advantage from hardware. If you're lucky, you can make something one and a half or two",
"times as good as your competitor, which probably isn't enough to be quite a competitive advantage. And it only lasts for six months.",
But software seems to take a lot longer for people to catch up with.,
"I watched Microsoft take eight or nine years to catch up with the Mac, and it's arguable whether they've even caught up.",
It takes a long time. And we think that the soonest we're going to have a true competitor is probably four to five years.,
So we've got that amount of time to grow ourselves a $1 to $2 billion company so that we,
"can compete with them on scale. See, today we can't compete with them on scale. We never have as many salespeople as they do,",
as Sun does. We don't have the ad budgets that they do. So we've got to have a better product.,
"And I hope we always have a better product, and I think we can. But I'd also like to be able to at least give them a run for their money on scale.",
"So we've got the next three to four years to run really fast, so that by the time they even get close to having a competitive product,",
"we're at a large enough scale to where we can start to compete with them. And that's what we're doing with our lives right now,",
Strategic Basis,
"spending a lot of time with customers, spending a lot of time making NeXTSTEP better, and that kind of thing.",
So that's the strategic basis of what we do. Does that make any sense to you?,
Have you run across the concept of sort of operational custom applications at all?,
"I mean, most of you have come from companies where you've had work experience, right? And you've all done that?",
"So do you have this problem in the companies you come from, of a lot of pressure to write these operational custom",
applications and hardly anything coming out of the spigot to satisfy this thirst?,
How many of you from Wall Street? Good.    Good How many of you from manufacturing companies?,
Excellent. Where are the rest of you from?,
"Consulting. How many from consulting? Oh, that's bad.",
A mind is too important to waste.,
You should do something.,
"Why is that bad? A consultant can come into a company and use your system, and basically build their applications",
"in predictably short amounts of time, and show them a working product. The only consultants I've seen that I think are truly useful",
"are the ones that help us sell our computers. No seriously, I don't think there's anything",
inherently evil in consulting.,
"I think that without owning something,",
Ownership,
"over an extended period of time-- like, a few years-- where one has a chance to take responsibility",
"for one's recommendations, where one has to see one's recommendations through all action stages",
"and accumulate scar tissue for the mistakes and pick oneself up off the ground and dust oneself off,",
one learns a fraction of what one can.,
"Coming in and making recommendations and not owning the results, not owning the implementation,",
"I think is a fraction of the value,",
"and a fraction of the opportunity to learn and get better. And so you do get a broad cut at companies, but it's very thin.",
"It's like a picture of a-- I'm a vegetarian, so I won't use steak. But it's like a picture of a banana.",
"You might get a very accurate picture, but it's only two dimensional.",
"And without the experience of actually doing it, you never get three dimensional.",
"So you might have a lot of pictures on your walls. You can show it off to your friends. You can say look, I've worked in bananas, I've worked in peaches, I've worked in grapes.",
But you never really taste it. And that's what I think.,
,
"You're also a variable expense. And in hard times, you find yourself.",
"You find yourself variable, right? If it's the software that's going to make or break",
"your company, how come you're putting out on platform. Why don't you put it on Sun's? They have a much larger base.",
"Right, very good question. I'm going to generalize your question. Why don't we just become a software company, right?",
"That's a very good question. It's a subtle question. I'm going to try to go through some several things, and I'm sorry if I jump around.",
NextStep 486,
We got a lot of requests from customers last year that they would love to see NeXTSTEP,
"on other platforms, and primarily, Intel-based platforms like the 486.",
"So we decided to do just that. And we have ported NeXTSTEP to the 486, and we're finishing it now.",
"And it will ship in the September, October timeframe. And it's exactly the same stuff we run in our own computer.",
"Same app, same user interface, same training, same development environment. And we're going to sell it for $9.95,",
"and we're OEMing it to a bunch of companies whose names you'll recognize quite easily, and OEMing it to them",
at a much cheaper price. And everybody's coming out of the woodwork to help us.,
We're getting help from Novell. We're getting help from all the developers. Intel's really helping us.,
"And they really want us to succeed. Why is that? Right. They all want to make sure that there's a choice out there,",
and they're all really scared about Microsoft. And they see NeXTSTEP as the only thing on the horizon that can challenge,
"Microsoft in system software for the next several years. So we're enjoying a lot of help, and boy we need it,",
"so that's good. Now, we've also had a lot of requests from companies to port NeXTSTEP to other platforms.",
"And we're talking to some of those companies right now. Now, we've got a lot of requests from Sun customers",
"the port NeXTSTEP to Sun. So a lot of them are saying, look, we may not want to buy them anymore, but we already bought 500, and we don't want to throw them in the bay.",
"So can we put your software in them? Because Sun's falling behind in software. Now, Sun says they'd rather stick needles in their eyes",
"than help us do this.    That's a quote. And so we're evaluating right now, which",
"will be worse for Sun, if we port it or if we don't port it? And since we're fairly customer-driven,",
"we'll probably end up doing what the customers ask us to do, because we want to make them happy. Now, this leads one into the question,",
Should we just be a software company,
should we just be a software company? And we think the answer is no. We think we should be a software company and a hardware company.,
"In making the decision to put NeXTSTEP on more than our own platforms, we clearly",
"decided that we will sell less than 100% of the NeXTSTEP hardware. However, we think that the marketplace will grow,",
"and we will sell more absolute hardware. And secondly, the charter of our hardware division",
"is to make the best NeXTSTEP hardware. Might not be the cheapest, might not be this, might not be that. But we think all in all, we can make the best stuff.",
And I would love at nothing better than if someday we only sold 20% or 25%,
of the NeXTSTEP hardware. But I still think that's a billion-dollar-plus hardware business.,
And I'll get into one other hardware-related reason in a minute.,
There are some things I can't talk about here.,
"In addition to that, if you look at how we sell our computers",
How we sell our computers,
"right now, we have a sales force in the US of about 130 professionals in the field",
"out selling NeXT computers. They spend 90% of their time selling NeXTSTEP software,",
"and then 10% of their time selling the hardware. In other words, if they can get the customer",
"to buy into NeXTSTEP, then they're going to sell the hardware, because right now we have the only hardware it runs on.",
So they are out there selling NeXTSTEP right now. And this is what is required to launch,
a new innovative product. The current distribution channels for the computer industry over the last several years,
"have lost their ability to create demand. They can fulfill demand, but they can't create it.",
"If a new product comes out, you're lucky if you can find somebody at the computer store that even knows how to demo it.",
"So the more innovative the product is, the more revolutionary it is and not just an incremental improvement, the more you're stuck.",
"Because the existing channel is only fulfilling demand. Matter of fact, it's getting so bad, that it's getting wiped out, because there are more efficient channels",
"to fulfill demand, like the telephone and Federal Express. So we're seeing the channel become condensed on its way",
to I think just telebusiness. So how does one bring innovation to the marketplace?,
"We believe the only way we know how to do it right now is with the direct sales force, out there in front of customers showing them",
"the products in the environment of their own problems, and discussing how those problems can be mated with these solutions.",
A software-only company could never afford to field a direct sales force.,
Software only companies,
"With average selling prices of $500 a software package, you could never afford 130 professionals in the field.",
"With an average selling price of $5,000, you can.",
And that's why I don't think we're going to see any more systems software companies succeed.,
I don't think it's possible to fund the efforts to educate the market about a revolutionary product with ASPs that low.,
"And if it's not a revolutionary product, I don't think the company can succeed. So our strategy has been that we've",
got to be a hardware company in order to make our software business succeed.,
"And we think we can do really well at both of them. I know that's a long answer, but it's a complex problem too.",
Yes?,
"Sure. If you ask us who our competitors are, we'll say really three things.",
Competition,
"One is Sun's Solaris software, the other is Microsoft, and the third is Taligent.",
"Let's take them in that order. Sun for a while had a software value added,",
"because they had the best Unix in the marketplace. But the market's moved way beyond that, and unfortunately, Sun hasn't.",
"So their software's falling further and further behind, and while we take them very seriously,",
"we don't think Solaris is going to be much competition. It doesn't have an object in it, and it's pretty much",
"what they have today. Microsoft is doing NT, which is their sort of second attempt",
"that a Unix wannabe. And that's great, and I think it will be better than the last one, which was OS/2.",
"But fundamentally, it's just an operating system. It's better plumbing for Windows. That's a good way of thinking of it.",
"Unfortunately, you're still stuck with Windows in all of its glory, including the worst development",
"environment that's ever been invented. And so we don't think that this is really going to present a challenge to what we're going after, which",
"are these mission-critical custom apps, because the development environment is horrendous, it's not object-oriented, and even with the better plumbing,",
we think it will be widely rejected for what we do.,
Talent,
"In terms of Taligent, Taligent represents the first true competitor that we could have.",
"They're going to ship a product around 1995, if they execute to their plans.",
"And I think if they do execute to their plans and work really hard, by about the mid '90s,",
"they'll have roughly what we have today. And that's not meant as a joke. It still means we have to run very hard,",
because they will have a lot of resources at their disposal. I think there's a lot of questions as to whether they,
"will ever ship a product. I think they're a few years away from having something running, unquote.",
"But we take them very seriously. Now, they've helped us enormously, because they've blessed object-oriented programming.",
"And right now, we're the only folks that have it, and will be for the next three or four years. So if we can't compete with Taligent,",
"it's probably because we've shot ourselves in the foot. You couldn't ask for something better. IBM and Apple saying, these guys are right on track,",
and come back in five years and we'll have it too. It's great. And so the ball's in our court.,
"Yes, in the back.",
You describe NeXTSTEP as an environment and an operating system. And what I hear you talk about is a great way,
to develop an application. I don't develop applications. I use other operating systems. Do you see a fracture of the operating system market,
"into a specialized niche that you're describing, and then the general market for those of us who don't develop apps?",
Or are you saying that you can then bridge from an environment that allows you to develop apps into an operating system that'll be like Windows or MS DOS,
"on a lot of machines? Well, let's get our terminology straight. We look at NeXTSTEP as an operating environment.",
NextStep,
"Much more than an operating system. Unix, which is our operating system, is 10% of NeXTSTEP.",
"So in these modern operating environments, when you develop a custom app in NeXTSTEP,",
it doesn't run on the Mac or on Windows. It can't. You need all the objects that come with NeXTSTEP,
to make it work. And let me go into a little detail there. How many of you are technical here?,
"A lot, OK, great. Well, we've discovered something. You don't write code any faster in NeXTSTEP",
"than you do in any other operating and development environment that we know of. However, to do a particular app on average, you write about 20%",
of the code that you do in any other development environment we know of.,
"About 20% of the code than in Sun or in anything else. So the code that's the fastest to write,",
"the code that's the easiest to maintain, and the code that never breaks, is the code you don't write.",
"So that's our strategy, write a lot less code. And the way we do this is we enable the developer",
to use a lot of objects that others have written. We ship six years worth of objects with NeXTSTEP.,
"You can create your own objects for your own company, and then reuse them around your developers. And there's now independent third party companies",
"not selling system software, not selling applications, but selling objects. There's not quite 10 of them, and it's starting.",
And I think it's going to be a very big thing. So in order to deliver these apps that,
"are created on the NeXTSTEP, you have to have NeXTSTEP so they can run on top and take advantage of this rich community of objects.",
And that's why we're porting NeXTSTEP to the 486. That's why you'll see NeXTSTEP running on several hardware platforms.,
"And will there be a fracturing, if you will?",
"Sure, to some extent. And I tend to look at it as a transition.",
"Was there a fracturing when Mac came out? Yes. And there's been more of a transition,",
"as people either move to Mac or in the case of Windows, adopt what's good about the Mac.",
Same thing's going to happen here. We believe very strongly that the benefits from these object-oriented environments-- not only just,
"rapid development, but a much richer user environment. If you use a NeXT, it's a lot nicer than a Mac or a PC,",
"even if you never developed an app. Other environments will absorb some of those breakthroughs,",
and more and more people will use NeXTSTEP. And things will tend to balance themselves out over time.,
But there will be a transition. And our goal is to make sure we're part of it.,
"Yeah. You spoke earlier that your competitive advantage, you felt lied in the fact that these companies today were",
"needing development on the operational basis, as opposed to the management.",
"Many companies, though-- or some, perhaps-- outsource their development. How does this change you business strategy?",
Good question. If our business strategy says that we do a lot of things,
App Development,
"well, but the tip of our arrow, or our Trojan horse, which is getting us into these large and medium-sized accounts",
"is our custom application development ability, then our growth is going to be paced among other things",
by the development community available to these companies to develop these apps.,
"Now, even though we have shrunk the development time down to a fraction of what it was, still",
"without developers out there, we're not going to win. Fortunately, most companies have really",
increased the staffs of good people in their IS departments dramatically in the last several years--,
last four or five years. There's now really bright people who know something about computer science in IS departments.,
"And most of the industries we talk to, whether they're healthcare, financial services, even law enforcement, places like that have on-site developers",
"in their IS teams. If not, they're starting to become a lot of vars, and people out there that we're using",
"in LA or in New York where I just was, we probably have about 10 independent third party companies helping parts of Wall Street develop things.",
So I think that's not going to be a stumbling block. My personal opinion is the number,
"of people in applications development is shrinking. It exploded in the '80s with PCs,",
but now that industry is consolidating. It's consolidating down to very few companies.,
"And there's a lot of excess people out there, that I think are starting to get channeled into some of these other areas.",
"So far, it hasn't been a problem. But if you want to do that, please call us and tell us, because we always need more.",
So what are you guys all going to do when you get out of here? You going to go back to your companies?,
How many of you are going to go back? How many aren't going to go back?,
What are you going to do?,
"Well yeah, I think we always have jobs for really smart, technical people.",
"You know, technically-based people. And you guys are getting a great business education here. Yeah, we'd love to talk to you about it.",
"Yes, sir. Well, I don't want to step on any toes here. Go ahead. But where do you Apple would be had you not left it?",
"And specifically, could it have come out with something as revolutionary in the tech industry?",
"Well, these are deep questions.",
"I'll tell you, I've obviously thought about this a lot. And I don't want to get into it too much. But I will say that I think everybody lost.",
I think I lost. And I wanted to spend my life there. I think Apple lost. I think customers lost.,
"And having said all that, so what? You go on. It's not as bad as a lot of things.",
"Not as bad as losing your arm. So people go on, and companies go on.",
Apples Struggle,
"And I think Apple-- I'm very happy every time Apple ships a Mac. It makes me very, very happy.",
I think the PowerBooks are decent products. I like them. But Apple has been struggling the last few years.,
They've been having a real struggle with who they want to be. And this is nothing new. We always had that.,
"That was part of what kept Apple alive, I think. And there were two camps within Apple. Camp one wanted to be the next serious computer company,",
and camp two wanted to sort of be the Sony of computers. And that struggling I think was somewhat tearing Apple apart.,
"And fortunately, the Sony guys have won. They've kind of decided to go be the Sony of computers.",
"And so the PowerBooks are pretty good, but the Quadras suck wind right now, the high end stuff.",
And they're basically not putting a lot of resources,
"onto the power users on desktops, and they've put most of their best people now on the portables and on consumer products",
"that they're going to be coming out with. And I think they'll do very well at that. Now, there's a problem in there, in that",
"if you look at the consumer products that sell over a million a year, you can count them on a few hands.",
"It turns out, there's not-- I mean, consumer electronics products, not like toothbrushes. But electronics products. And so let's assume they have one of those or two of those.",
Let's say they have a product that sells two million a year at a $500 ASP to them. So it sells to the consumer at $795 or something like that.,
"That's what, a billion dollars, right? two million a year, $500 apiece.",
It's a billion dollars. They still have to get the other $7 billion of revenue somewhere.,
So it's going to be an interesting transition as the ASPs get lower.,
"The volumes have to get much, much higher, and you run into some scale issues when you look out at the consumer electronics industry.",
"Not that it's not possible. And I think it's going to be really interesting to watch. And we also see a lot of not quite that clarity of movement,",
but some movement in the Windows and PC world again towards taking what they have now,
and making it portable. But not giving the top third of the market more power.,
"You know, System 7 on the Mac was supposed to be the second coming. And it wasn't. It turned out to be an incremental improvement.",
"OS/2 was supposed to take us into new dimensions, and it turned out to be a complete failure. And they're going to throw another $100 million",
after it just to make sure you all know about it.    And so there is a third of those desktops,
out there that the users and the people that want to deploy more,
sophisticated apps are-- they're in the desert wanting something to drink.,
"And I think there's a tremendous opportunity to give them some solutions. Now, that doesn't mean that Apple is not",
going to be successful. It just means they're going to go off in another direction.,
"Who knows what would have happened had all this not happened. Yes, up in the corner?",
"You've talked a lot about making products. I wonder if you could talk about the management at NeXT, and if you see changing at all, as you hope, go",
from $120 million company to a $1 billion company. Sure.,
NeXT Hiring,
"Yeah, we're-- we've done a lot in the last year. The most significant things we did",
"were, one, we hired this guy right here. Mike Slade is our VP of Marketing.",
He spent-- you can stand up.    No.,
"And he's cheap, too.    And Mike spent seven or eight years at Microsoft.",
"And I originally met him, he was the Product Manager for Excel when it first came out, and ended up",
running big pieces of marketing for Microsoft. So Mike runs all the marketing at NeXT. And Mike came in to NeXT just about the time,
when we were finally hearing what these big companies were saying about mission critical custom apps. And so we've worked very closely together,
to redefine the marketing strategy of the company. And Mike is done just a superb job at that.,
"The second big thing we did was, about three months ago,",
"a little over three months ago, we consolidated our hardware design engineering, our manufacturing,",
"our worldwide distribution, and hardware service all into one chunk called the hardware division.",
"So from cradle to grave, they have hardware responsibility. And we're in the process of forming the software division",
"right now, so that we're all still under the same roof,",
but we have clarity about the fact that we've got to make two businesses successful.,
"The third thing that we did was-- and we have a really great person running that, Rich Page, who is one of the founders of NeXT.",
"And he's doing a great job running that. We hired a new CFO recently, Marcel Gani.",
"He's from Intel, spent 12 years at Intel doing some pretty interesting jobs.",
"He ran all of finance for Europe. He ran all of internal audit for the Board. He ran all of manufacturing, planning, and scheduling",
"for a while, and things like that. He's a pretty good guy, went to Cyprus for a year and a half,",
"and then came to NeXT. And he's great. And then recently, as a matter of fact, about last week, I hired a Chief Operating Officer, a guy",
named Peter van Cuylenburg. And Peter is someone I first met when,
we were looking for an Executive Vice President to the Sales and Marketing. And he turned me down for the job. And we subsequently decided not to hire that position.,
And I've been chasing him for the last year and a half almost. He's really good.,
"He spent a lot of time at TI as Europe, and about three years ago, went to a company called Mercury",
"Communications in England-- they're the MCI of the UK-- and turned that company around to about $2 billion,",
"and then was promoted to run half of Cable &-- or half of Mercury's parent company, Cable & Wireless,",
and was running-- they're about $6 billion. And he went there when he thought that communications,
"and computing were going to, kind of, come together, but never happened. And he figured out that his real love",
"is in the computer business. He's very, very good, operationally, so that's just happened last week.",
"It seems like all the good people I really want to hire, it seems take me a year to hire them. Them And it's always been that way, even at Apple.",
"Some of the best technical people, or whoever, it always seemed to take me, like, a year to pry them out of HP, or wherever, and took me over a year to hire--",
I think Mike has the award. You're about a year and a half. And they're all worth it.,
"What happens is, I usually meet somebody that is really good-- I think is very, very good. And you can't get them.",
"And then you go try to find other people. And nobody measures up. You know, when you meet somebody that good, just, you always compare them to this one person.",
And you know you're going to be settling for second best if you compromise. And I've always found it best not,
"to compromise, and just keep chipping away.",
So I think we're doing quite a bit. It feels like we're running the company a lot better now than we ever have.,
We've definitely made our share of mistakes. Yeah? What technological advances do you,
see coming over the next five to 10 years? and how is NeXTSTEP structured to take advantage of those?,
I'll give you a global answer. Then we can descend into some details.,
"I believe that you can use the concept of technology windows opening, and then eventually closing.",
"And what I mean by that is, enough technology, usually from fairly diverse places,",
"comes together, and makes something that's a quantum leap forward possible.",
"And it doesn't come out of nowhere. If you poke around the labs, and you hang around the Media Lab here at MIT and other places, you can, kind of, get a feel",
"for some of those things. And usually, they're not quite possible. But, all of a sudden, you start to sense things coming",
"together, and the planets lining up, to where this is now possible, or barely possible.",
And a window opens up. And it usually takes around--,
"my experience anyway, my life has been, it takes around five years to create a commercial product",
that takes advantage of that technical window opening up. Sometimes you start before the window is quite open.,
"And you can't get through it. And you push it up. And you push it up. Sometimes it just takes a lot of work, took that long with the Apple II,",
"took that long with the Mac. You know, it took a Lisa along the way, $100 million.",
"It takes a while. It's a expensive to push those windows open. And in our case, you know, our first product failed.",
"We came out with this cube. And we sold 10,000 of them. Why? Because we weren't quite there yet.",
"And we made some mistakes along the way. And we had to course correct. You know, Macintosh was a course correction off the Lisa.",
"So with Apple II and III, we did it in reverse.",
"It takes around five years, or some number of years like that, to realize that window opening.",
And then it seems to take about another five years to really exploit it in the marketplace.,
"And let me give you some examples. from my life. Apple II lasted 15 years, 15 years.",
"The hardware churned. But basically, it was the same for 15 years. DOS-- you know, DOS, just passed 10 years.",
"I don't think anyone would disagree that it's going to easily last another five, right-- unfortunately.",
"And Mac, you know, Mac is eight years old, right? No question it's going to last another four or five",
"years, right? These things are hard. They don't last because it's convenient, or even because it's economic.",
"They last because they're really-- this is hard stuff to do. And so when we are pushing that window open,",
"I think with our current generation of products, we finally got the window open. After six years, it's open.",
We've got an extremely elegant implementation. And we've got five years of work to do to exploit it,
"in the marketplace. You know, we'll peak in five years. Five years, we'll all sit around,",
"and say, OK, it's time to get started on the next thing. It's time to get going on the next thing-- maybe four years from now.",
"But we've got a lot of work ahead of us just to move this thing out, and educate the market, and continue to refine it based on market feedback.",
"So everything I know about technology windows that are open, or just about open, is in NeXTSTEP,",
"or we're working on it in the labs. And these things generally don't come along independently. They, kind of-- clumps of them come together,",
has been my experience. So the things that aren't in there right now that I,
"can talk about, there's some video stuff that's really interesting, that's going to be integrated in.",
There some security stuff that's really fascinating that's integrating in. But most of the core technologies in there--,
"products are getting smaller and portable. Products are getting much, much faster. But these things are well known.",
"You know, the products that we can put on-- that we can give to you in the next year or two",
are going to be running at speeds that I find hard to believe. And I've been doing this for a while.,
So I think the windows open. And I think object-oriented technology,
"is the biggest technical breakthrough I have seen since the early '80s,",
"with the graphical user interfaces. And I think it's bigger, actually. It will prove to be bigger over time.",
"Yes? I have a question. If the value    and things like operational applications, and NeXTSTEP",
"is a tool to help you build those, where do you draw the line in capturing the most value between actually developing applications,",
"something like Word or Excel, and becoming a tool builder to support those people who may capture a little bit more of the value?",
Where do you want to draw the line there? If you're a software company? If you're a software company.,
Microsofts made it easy,
"Well, Microsoft has made it easy. Repeat the question. Yeah, oh, sorry, the question is, if you're a software company, should you develop apps,",
"or should you develop objects and tools? And see, the software industry, with Microsoft, and Lotus, and WordPerfect made it real easy.",
Unless you've got $20 million or $30 million burning a hole in your pocket so you can go out and hire a few hundred people to develop what it takes to develop one,
"of these polished shrink-wrapped apps on Mac or on Windows, then you don't have much of a choice.",
"There's not a real opportunity there to-- assuming you had the best spreadsheet today, you could easily spend $50 million",
"marketing it before you'd be breaking even selling it, because of just how expensive it is to market a product today.",
"But that's only for existing spreadsheets. If you're trying to develop a next-level generation of it, a different type of product.",
"Well, assume that you have a breakthrough spreadsheet. Again, on mainstream platforms, it will take $50 million",
to just rise above the noise level and market it. So what the brightest people I know of today are doing,
is they're writing objects. They're writing hunks of things that other developers,
are going to use to build apps. And they're going where everybody isn't.,
"And that's, I think, going to be the next new thing. Yeah? You mentioned that a possible problem for Macs",
"is the lack of developers and consultants out there who recommend it. Based on that view, what's the NeXT view",
of how to market itself to academic institutions?,
Marketing to higher education,
"I think your question is, what is our philosophy on marketing our products to higher education? Mhm.",
"Well, we started off selling only to higher education, which arguably, was a mistake.",
"And But we've done really well there. And our hearts are there. And we sold a lot of Macintoshes there too,",
when we were at Apple. And I think it's a no-brainer. I think you take your products.,
You discount them as heavily as you can. You sell them into higher education. Higher education is a wonderful place,
"to give you great feedback about how to make your products better, and what's wrong with them. And it's a great place to educate bright people",
"that you can hire, and that your customers can hire when they graduate, so we do exactly that. We have-- I think were sold on about 350 campuses",
in the United States. We are clearly the number one selling workstation across the US.,
"And we're the number two selling computer of any type at campuses, like here MIT or Stanford,",
right behind the Macintosh. We sell more computers at MIT than PCs,
through the institutional resale engines. So we do as much as we can.,
"And I think it's been pretty effective. What do you think? I mean, for example,    is going away.",
"Like, the support    is going. Right. I mean, I'm talking about, not just selling computers. I'm talking about establishing a network",
"of institutionalized system   .. Well, what's happening is--",
Project Athena,
"see, the Project Athenas didn't succeed for a reason. They didn't succeed, because they had a lot of good ideas",
"as a research project, but the people necessary to commercialize those things and make them into real products aren't",
necessarily the same people that are going to pioneer the ideas at a university like MIT.,
"And so those projects never quite get baked. The recipes, kind of, developed.",
"And you make a few samples. And it's pretty good, but the computer industry is pretty advanced. And so other people pick up those ideas,",
"and make them into real products. And they, kind of, leave the research projects in the dust if the researchers drop research and start",
trying to commercialize stuff. And I can point to 100 examples of that in higher education. So it's probably good that Project Athena has,
"a beginning, a middle, and an end, so that those people don't get stuck trying to do commercial software in an academic environment.",
"It's, kind of, a mismatch. As far as we're concerned, what we're doing is,",
there's a lot of labs that are being put in in higher education. And we're winning almost every one of those.,
"And we really go hard after the lab, so that people that can't afford the computers have public access.",
And most universities now have fairly elaborate campus-wide networks. It's no longer a new cutting-edge thing.,
"And we plug right into those. So I think it's-- life's moved beyond where it was a few years ago, where",
those kind of projects were really important. And the knowledge to do that exists fairly widespread.,
"I think a few more and-- yeah? What's the most important thing that you personally learned at Apple, that you're doing at NeXT?",
Good question.,
"I'm not sure I learned this when I was at Apple, but I learned it based on the data when I was at Apple.",
Taking a longerterm view,
"And that is, I now take a longer-term view on people.",
"In other words, when I see something not being done right, my first reaction isn't to go fix it.",
"It's to say, we're building a team here.",
"And we're going to do great stuff for the next decade, not just the next year, and so what do",
I need to do to help so that the person that's screwing up learns versus how do I fix the problem?,
And that's painful sometimes. And I still have that first instinct to go fix the problem.,
But that's taking a longer-term view and people is probably the biggest thing that's changed.,
"And then and I don't know. That's maybe the part that's biological, but--",
"Yes? To pull off on that question, I wanted to ask you about your management style,",
"and specifically, how do you resolve conflict in your organization? What's our management style?",
"How do we resolve conflict? I've never believed in the theory that, if we're on the same management team,",
Buying into decisions,
"and a decision has to be made, and I decide in a way that you don't like, and I say, come on, buy into the decision.",
"You know, buy into it. Like, we're all in the same team, you don't agree, but buy into it. Let's go make it happen.",
"Because what happens is, sooner or later, you're paying somebody to do what they think is right,",
"but then you're trying to get them to do what they think isn't right. And sooner or later, it outs.",
And you end up having that conflict. So I've always felt that the best,
"way is to get everybody in a room, and talk it through until you agree.",
"Now, that's not everybody in the company, but that's everybody that's really",
"involved in that decision, that needs to execute it. And so that's how we try to run NeXT.",
"The way we run NeXT is, we have a team at the top we call the Policy Team. There's eight people.",
Mike is on it. I'm on it. We have six other people on it. And the key-- we have two things we try to do.,
"One is, we try to differentiate between the really important decisions and the ones that we don't have to make.",
"And the really important ones, we work on it until we all agree, because we're paying people",
"to tell us what to do. In other words, I don't view that we pay people to do things. That's easy, to find people to do things.",
"What's harder is to find people to tell you what should be done, right? That's what we look for. So we pay people a lot of money, and we expect",
"them to tell us what to do. And so when that's your attitude, you shouldn't run off and do things if people don't all",
feel good about them. And the key to making that work is to realize there's not that many things that any one team really has to decide.,
"And we might have 25 really important things we have to decide on a year, not a lot.",
So that's how we try to run it. Sometimes it works. And sometimes we're still working on it.,
"I can't think of once-- I can't-- maybe there's once or twice, but I can't even recall a time when I've said, dammit,",
"I'm the CEO. And we're doing it this way, you know? I can recall a time when I've said, we don't see eye-to-eye,",
and you're off the team.    You know?,
"I've had to say that once or twice, over a prolonged period of time, when a person has not",
"wanted to go in the same direction we've wanted to go in as a team. It's my job every once in a while to say, hey,",
you want to go this way? We want to go this way. It's not working.,
"But when people are on the team, then we work it out.",
"Yeah? You've, kind of, chosen this direction, this niche towards the premium product,",
"versus you've discussed Macintosh going into portability, and a lot of these portability issues. Do you think portability is exclusive?",
Can you do that and still do some of the market-driven type stuff as well?,
"I want to come back to your premium product characterization, because our products actually cost close to half of what Sun's do.",
Manufacturing,
"And the reason they do is, we have the most automated factory in the industry. And we have a great VLSI design group,",
"which designs stuff in a lot less parts. Do you guys-- manufacturing, do you care about that? Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah.",
We should talk about that in a minute. The industry is bifurcating right now.,
"And what's happening is, is that the Macs and the PCs as you know them today are all going to be just like this-- hold up your PowerBook.",
"They're all going to be just like this, only lighter and smaller, before very long.",
"And they're taking the technology we have today, not particularly changing it, and getting it",
"off the desktop in portable forms. And they're giving up a few things for that, but nothing terribly profound.",
"However, we're getting all sorts of signals from certain parts of the markets that they want things that are the enemy of that, right?",
"Well, what are they? Well, speed-- speed is the enemy of portability,",
"because speed takes power, right? So the kind of speed that our customers want,",
it would run for 3 and 1/2 minutes on batteries. And that's useless.,
"The second thing they want is, they want a lot more storage on their disk drives, and a lot more memory, again, the enemy of portability",
"for power and size reasons. Another thing they want is really high-speed networking,",
"right? The radio LANs on these things, at best, are going to go 19.2 kilobits per second.",
Our customers want 100 megabits per second and higher. You're not going to do that with a radio LAN anytime in the next five years.,
"Another thing our customers want is our mix has shifted to, like, 80% color. And they want true color to do photographs.",
"There is no flat panel color display today that will do photographic-quality color. And they want big ones, because once you have multitasking,",
"and you run a bunch things at once, you need a bigger window into this electronic world. When you're using your computer for two or three hours a day,",
you don't want to be looking through blinders this big. You want something bigger.,
"So these are all the enemy of that today. And we're working on smaller products, for sure,",
"but it's really tough to get both. And we're optimizing for the power,",
because we see a giant hole there for running these mission-critical custom apps.,
"And what people are doing needs more power, so that's what we're optimizing for. Let's talk about manufacturing.",
"How many of you have a manufacturing background? Oh, that's great. I love manufacturing.",
And what kinds of things? What kinds of companies? You have--,
Pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals? Any auto people here? Yeah. Him. Auto?,
"Electronics? Which TI. TI, uh-huh. Motorola. Motorola? Is it true you're sending your manufacturing",
"overseas, or just-- I heard-- Yeah, I heard that rumor, too. No, it couldn't be further from the truth.",
"We love manufacturing at NeXT. And when I was at Apple, I had the good fortune",
"to lead the effort to build a Mac factory. And we designed, and built, and operated that factory.",
And it was a real breakthrough. It was the best factory in the industry until we built the at NeXT. And we made a lot of--,
"We made a lot of mistakes, though. As an example, I remember walking through it.",
"You know, one of the things you learn when you start building factories is that warehouses are really bad, right?",
"Warehouses are bad, because you tend to put things in them. And inventory is really bad. Inventory is really bad, because if it's defective,",
"you don't find out about it for a while. And you don't close the quality feedback loop with the vendor, and correct the problem, until they've made a zillion of them.",
"What you want to do is find the problem the first one that comes in the door, and stop them from making more until you fix the problem.",
"So warehouses also cost money, because you put all this stuff in them. And the stuff-- you have to go borrow money from the bank,",
"or use money that could be used in a more productive purpose, so warehouses are bad.",
"And you want to go to JIT. I'm sure you've studied this all, and studied examples. I was walking through the Mac factory one day,",
and the two biggest pieces of automation we put in were a giant small-part storage and retrieval system.,
It was the totes that ran around. And the second one was this giant burn in system at the end.,
"And a few tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment. And I realized, unfortunately too late, that both of them",
are warehouses. They're just high-tech warehouses.,
"And so when we looked at NeXT, we said no warehouses of any kind.",
"We have a true JIT factory. Stuff comes in, and is delivered right to the point of use on the factory floor.",
"There is no warehouse. Deliveries are made daily, sometimes more frequently",
than that. There is no outgoing warehouse. Everything is visible.,
And the reason that we were able to do a lot of what we've done,
