you should know assuming yeah welcome to Nobel week Stockholm yeah and all Nobel,1
laureates yeah I were asked to bring a thing an artifact to the Nobel Missy in Stockholm yes so what did you bring yeah,1
I loved these true things yeah I I won't explain now those are,1
gift from my colleagues last year I got this and this is a miniature of 27 years,1
ago on me and they III didn't know,1
though that was a secret that I I was got I got this one after such that to,1
celebrate her party in Spanish they gave me this quiet it's very very cute yeah,1
and this is the way you do your research Oh always I yesterday I said the,1
probably the origin of my world the first I found the phenomena and for,1
me that was a starting point of my work and so I like microscope you to use to,1
see something and I believe the discovery of this some sort of a,1
phenomena is most important for biology still I think oh yeah so many my,1
colleague knows that so they gave me,1
this miniature this is their my for a 27 years old so I had a black back here but,1
it's very much like you yeah thank you that this one yeah and those ones either,1
yesterday I told about what is ATG gene,1
and this is a 8212 it's a big thing like molecule,1
bound to 80 zhuhai and combined by a tg16 diamond so this is the first we,1
solved the structure of a t12 5/16 body,1
to end this one was also present from a colleague two years ago or something,1
this is exactly another you became like molecule this molecule the homeowner of,1
this molecule in moment is so called lc3 that is very important molecule for,1
research so those I brought otherwise I,1
don't have many any special things so I,1
was thinking and when you were born in 1945 in Japan it's a Skype kind of a,1
When were you born,1
rough time then oh yes but I did they do,1
not remember because I was so young so then then when I was young boy Japanese,1
recovered so quickly everything is goes up so my young age,1
were up to probably still graduate still,1
undergraduate that everything is quite positive period then I yeah then we have,1
now because now we have worth some sort of their mature,1
society and and we have many earthquakes right like volcanoes,1
yeah different so I yeah with you everything is not so stable yeah I never,1
saw that kind of thing when I was young I was wondering and when you were a young boy what did you picture yourself,1
When were you a young boy,1
doing as a grownup yeah probably probably I said yeah I have no talent to,1
drawing or sports or something yeah probably I have not so many choices okay,1
yeah my father was a process person took,1
Kyushu University and my parents probably expected even beat Society for,1
me yeah it's not yeah it's not that,1
far-fetched for ya Yin but you started out studying chemistry and then you,1
Switching from chemistry to biology,1
switched to biology yes that okay a little bit I said in the mixture I you,1
understand the chemistry is so as a long story and also I established so when I,1
went to the Tokyo University chemistry,1
lecture was not so stimulate dip for me but that time as I said the molecular,1
biology that period and everything is so fresh for me and it was so fascinating,1
movie so I want to be a molecular,1
biologist that there is nine I have know,1
for example in high school age I haven't take powers ecosphere lecture but,1
immediately I interested in the world I was under graduate school so was it,1
Inspiration,1
any particular person that inspired you oh ma I care about yeah yeah yeah yeah,1
probably I want saying that extra that was very,1
good time for me so Justin and every,1
they were for example genetic code as,1
the spring so ATG means or without me or,1
that kind of things I was so excited to,1
me so that was that of course I learned about the near bar coach or something,1
yeah that's my issue of their molecular biology yeah,1
according to your experience what personal characteristics are valuable to,1
Personal characteristics,1
a scientist what do you need - I it's,1
not sterile type of research I'm,1
probably I'm not typical why not I don't,1
know I I like as I said I'm not a,1
competitive person and I want to study,1
something I interested but many many,1
successful scientists do not behave like like me yes but I hope every not not on,1
the scientist our society should have,1
heterogeneity at a very important for human yeah so,1
and what a difference the ampulla needed yeah so even scientists we should have,1
many types of and this I I don't know,1
what should be I don't want to say this is a most typical or most important way,1
to use that science also you have yeah that might have been even worse I yeah,1
Research group,1
and you're still running a research group the you said that it's important,1
with different kinds of scientists do you think like that when you in your team do you do you also have different,1
yeah it's so of course when I started,1
notoriety just important things what's going on buy more for your am study and,1
then genetic stock and then work your biological research study so even though,1
Auto Fuji yeah we should focus some,1
thread up their subject during my 27,1
years so but my I hope my lab health are,1
heterogeneous people just doing this research you know to resolve their own,1
prophecy so someone should be molecular,1
iris somewhere genetics number biochemist good luck biochemist some,1
cell biologists yeah I won't have were quite heterogeneous people in my in my,1
home do you still do your own experiments Oh sometimes I try but it's,1
very difficult yeah we need some constant in time so I started some some,1
day but I should give up to continue so,1
it's a I cannot say I'm doing but I research by myself yeah I was,1
thinking if we turn to your discovery mmm so this is you can okay say yes is you,1
show it to the camera like that that's a very schematic yeah yeah yeah picture,1
what it Otto Ferdie yeah might be but you show that Otto Fuji which is self,1
eating and it's not only a way of degrading material it's also about,1
recycling mm-hmm so why does ourselves need a system for,1
recycling okay I always said for example,1
if you stop if you know not have any,1
hood it's quite often a challenge in,1
nature for example you can see many TV programs out there polar bear could,1
cannot get any food for several days and many many you can have that candle lion,1
even lion cannot get so in their pollution any starvation is the most,1
challenge two daughters - so we should have their recycling system at the,1
beginning of their our life so I think for example if I we one day starvation i,1
I don't know what I heard the our people,1
cheering - 70 percent of the bell volume Wow yeah that means the autophagy is very,1
important for our whole body labor to,1
the auto Fuji and degrade that they are one protein and I mean I said surprise everywhere in,1
your body and especially for brain hmm and quite interestingly if you start our,1
body every cell most almost all part of,1
our organ starts out of it but only,1
brain doesn't so that means playing the lab system is so important so first they,1
are protected for starvation that means they're other for example liver it's,1
also important for some survival,1
yeah so I believe there's recycling it's,1
a very important yeah I die I want to emphasize yeah and if you're if you are,1
Worst problem,1
cell cell too much a tougher D or too little what is the worst problem for sale,1
probably yeah as I said of course so the recycling problem with for,1
example our auto festival to be so cannot survive under starvation,1
condition that means the recycling is a very important for survival and also as,1
yesterday autophagy has another function to get rid of the harm for excessive,1
must be years so if you have defect in,1
notify see many harmful protein or shampoo or dangers organ accumulate in,1
ourselves that is also very dangerous for life so both of us if,1
now we know what the fidgets effect has many many defecting health or disease,1
problem that many people interested in and out of the G that's one of the most,1
important yes and because we talk about recycling in nature and the environment,1
there are some materials in our environment that are not easily degraded,1
or recycle and you know plastic things that end our lives is the same thing in cells or the particular materials that,1
are hard to degrade and recycle yeah probably in usual case lysosome has so,1
important activity to degrade almost everything so but we know many many,1
lysosome disease that cannot delayed for examples specific proteins or specific,1
molecule those are all those call goes there some sort when he serious problem,1
of health we long long time who we know are many many lysosome disease but we,1
didn't have any autophagy disease probably autopathy is more fundamental function,1
so probably both of if you have a severe outfit effect they cannot survive so we,1
didn't have any specific disease world autophagy that my I think that that,1
might be maybe just here this should be,1
like in a mammalian cell because this is Eliza salmon and it's encapsulating,1
there things that should be and here it's yeah like but you did you research that's why we had this little,1
factory your favorite organism yeah the jeast and so okay yeah no that's why we bought,1
that yeah okay first I will explain yeah the auto fudgy most important event is,1
how to seek a star potion was height so,1
o to into autofocus moon yeah but no nothing was known about the,1
molecular mechanism forming designed with strategy so so that was the thing yeah yeah I so we need probably we need,1
quite good model system then when I,1
started I was working on the back you it not like though we have only this kind,1
of big it compartment and eyes my eye my,1
eye assume this must be homologous to,1
the lysosome so I want to know if this,1
is really the data compartment how this material come across the membrane so I,1
thought meaning we are doing some sort of membrane biology yeah but I they're,1
beginning my starting point versus found this kind of structure inside about you,1
and then electron microscopy of this,1
process the probe this is exactly the similar phenomena shown this and of,1
course lysosome is much much smaller than vacu but you can see all of,1
some performed two and then she was with me tea compartment and hydrolytic enzyme,1
attack the inner membrane structure so,1
when you were looking like this at what point did you understand that you had,1
made a breakthrough discovery but what was there yeah,1
when I told this is a electron,1
microscope but I just sold this phenomena under write more a microscope,1
and I thought these structures are moving around in the vacuum yeah,1
graduate is structure accumulating the backhoe and that was so it reached me,1
quite fascinating phenomena so I was convinced I might have a real yeah in,1
someone what was the feeling in your heart at that time yeah yeah that was the really,1
probably most exciting and in my life yeah yeah you mentioned that before but,1
Starting a career today,1
he said that one reason why I started to study at offered you was that you don't,1
feel that you're very a very competitive person so you choose that kind of field yeah so I was just wondering if you were,1
starting your career today yeah what field would you yeah I many times I,1
asked a similar question yeah I always say probably if I'm now I may not study,1
out of us because it's is so popular and many preprinted of course their auto,1
body is just a general word for many,1
many autophagy against analyze a structure,1
biology well and cell biology in many many way but probably is so popular so,1
I'm want to make another subject to a,1
while welcome but yeah like watch was what extent yes I always say it I was,1
too old and for me always say even in,1
East we know about 30 percent of the mystery of the auto fission is probably,1
less than 30 percent Nima marion autophagy so there are many many things,1
to analyze father so in that case i,1
might start off Papaji in some aspect of,1
the prophecy I don't know being a,1
Frustrating times,1
researcher can sometimes be frustrating yeah I understand yeah,1
and did you during those frustrating times did you ever think of giving up,1
just quit and do something completely different,1
yeah,1
I'm not so hard to have a good result so,1
I have not so much pressure to do of,1
course one reason is auto fudgie is so new field and not so many people working,1
out of me so I was really happy every single is new for me yeah so but we,1
example when we started the cloning of 80 genes we had everything's are noble,1
and we haven't get any answer to what they are doing so that was the very,1
frustrating time and I didn't so much,1
worried about but many people say at that time,1
you always complain now under science meeting we have so travel unhappy,1
yeah it is voting so for how long time did you endure without getting into,1
T12 system,1
results but yeah we found a t12 system,1
and within two or three years we got many many new findings then so from them,1
everything is a some sort of there we should to get information about the G,1
protein and how they are working in the cell so we have many many problem should,1
be solved so we started yet exactly that,1
way but probably I'm balanced and I want to be know what is really what was he,1
doing nice so I couldn't pursue that,1
kind of for a long time because I have so many things to do so now I go what the,1
original questions now in my lab so I what is working on earth,1
what independent how about our materials,1
is degrading life is over vacuum that much yes Christian my house you,1
Technical skills,1
mentioned that when he will little your mother had technical skills and one of,1
the first things you got to know what's about the streptomycin yeah yeah yeah,1
but you never did you never were interested in being a doctor oh yes I know if I so many very good,1
risk doctor at that moment probably I,1
think the medicine is one of the most,1
important field but I don't know that,1
wasn't the case yeah you like to look at the stars and nature yeah you are now I,1
Advice for younger scientists,1
mean you mentioned that you've been struggling yourself yeah and but now you were about to receive the Nobel Prize,1
and very successful and so do you have any piece of advice for younger,1
scientists that are now in the process were you worried for what yeah unfortunately I saw the special in Japan,1
but I heard I met Swedish scientist yes,1
they were that day before yesterday also they feel it is not so good time for,1
basic research because,1
a little bit younger generation in Japan,1
for your example professor fifty or,1
sixty they it is not easy to get the money told they should write the grant,1
application every time and also it's not so easy and they feel very competitive,1
and also many many other administrative job things happen to me here to them so,1
they have not good time to concentrate on science so young generation watching,1
their P I they looks not so happy when I,1
was yeah so I hope I want me change that,1
kind of situation and but for young,1
generation yeah if you these days what,1
happened for them is a you should have a good paper when you have undergraduate,1
school or postdoc you should always pushed their fish to have a big general,1
paper or something yeah but it means if you you should work on popular topics,1
because it is much has a chance to get,1
nature science or a cell paper but so it,1
is very difficult to stick on their new,1
subject but thank you dear yeah so my advice to the young general,1
if you really have you can believe you,1
can have good results and as many many income very competitive few you let go,1
but if you really interesting something something you had better keep that,1
question yeah so don't hurry or you had,1
better finder phenomena you can continue,1
five years ten years twenty years thirty seven years yeah yeah that's my advice,1
Family,1
finally we have talked a lot about your work and you will carry you but when it,1
comes to life outside of the laboratory mmm and what is important to you yeah,1
probably in my case my wife took care a lot to me,1
and I should appreciate her help and,1
yeah it's very difficult to do everything so nicely but now I won't,1
happen for tab and more relaxed times so,1
it's earth yet attacking for me I was,1
just thinking maybe I haven't been your family and your relations had been important for for your scientific,1
achievement yeah yeah probably my I had,1
two sons but they didn't when entered and science will probably they watch me,1
thank you very much ok time domo arigato got so much,1
How did you receive the news that you have been awarded the Nobel Prize?,1
the first message I received from another foundation was by telephone call,1
it was around the 5:00 p.m. of October 1st and actually people told me,1
something happens maybe before 4 o'clock so we are completely free out of these,1
things and we're concentrating with my colleague about the our paper in the,1
manuscript editing and suddenly my secretary came with some stiff face and,1
nope that they opened the door and you have to take the phone so I was not so,1
sure what's going on something bad or good I took the phone and the person,1
recording was said dr. Perlman so I made it to catch the point and then I had a,1
very nice and pleasant conversation but often I heard there is a fake call and,1
so of course he also mentioned I asked him to send the email to just confirm,1
and I won so I received the email it was real and so we told everybody in the,1
love and of course my family and other kind of the good exciting,1
celebration - I mean the nice picture. And the picture we took then was posted on,1
the website of the Nobel Foundation so it was a very exciting and a pleasant,1
and unforgettable incidence in my life,1
Why did you decide to become a scientist?,1
there are several reasons first I have to decide whether go to medical school,1
or law school or several other choices of course I went to medical school are,1
strongly influenced by my father and also I mean the family reason and,1
secondly I read the biography of Hideo Noguchi who was the very interesting,1
doctor with the United States in his 20s and become professor in the Rockefeller,1
Institute and he found these ciphers as a cause of the policies and also he died,1
in Ghana during his study on the yellow fever pathogen so that was very striking,1
and I went medical school and the other reason I've had a friend only a father,1
and son and he died of the stomach cancer very acute and I was very much,1
you know very sad and I thought what I can do anything,1
for this type of the diseases,1
Can you describe the main impact of your discovery?,1
so cancer immunotherapy has been I mean idea has been around many decades before,1
Jim Allison and myself demonstrated in the above system the reason why many,1
people failed one after another is they didn't realize the immune system is,1
already suppressed by the tumor growth so if we push the accelerator of the,1
immune system while the immune system is under the strong brake there is no way,1
they can drive the immune system forth and only the people find the major,1
immune negative regulator means a break that was say therefore and pd1 and Jim,1
Allison first showed say therefore blockade can cure the cancer in animal,1
model and soon after we found a pit I mean the we found a pity one before but,1
we demonstrated pd-1 blockade can also cure the cancer unfortunately the pretty,1
one is less toxic video and blockade I mean and has chronic and now it used in,1
a wide spectrum of tumors starting from melanoma lung cancer renal cancer,1
stomach cancer meaning that's slightly advantage of the PD one over C therefore,1
C therefore has a very strong activity and sometime too strong,1
also a bit side effect is stronger I received many prizes of course before,1
How does it feel to do work that saves lives?,1
the novel prize and this is a probably last prize I get but I felt when I see,1
the patient and saying they were saved by the therapy we developed is the most,1
moving and also the time I feel my life has some meat so that was the very very,1
you know unforgettable and I was so very touchy and I feel I feel about it I'm,1
Can you tell us about some of the cancer patients youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve met?,1
not the clinician but I've involved some clinical trials and the one lady who had,1
a big tumor this is ovarian tumor and doctor of,1
course thought hopeless but she recovered and there was almost five,1
years ago and treatment lasted one year and she is still tumor free and enjoying,1
her life one time I saw she playing golf so there was a real amazing and similar,1
story I pray golf myself and I have a friend,1
who told me this is my last round in my life because I had lung cancer but,1
if what about maybe half a year was so later he came back and I just started,1
the treatment you developed and he just completely cured was fantastic well,1
Do you have a message for those who are fighting cancer today?,1
unfortunately the our treatment is still not complete only 20 to 30 percent our,1
responders and we have a long way to go but now this is the just beginning and,1
many many scientists in the industry jumped in so I hope this therapy of the,1
or widely used and reach to the almost everybody in the world hopefully by the,1
end of the century just like the infectious diseases almost,1
completely eradicated in during the last century,1
I hope the century will be remembered at the century of the cancer treatment,1
that's my,1
Do you think that diversity is important for fruitful research?,1
yes I think so,1
always especially in the life science we don't know exactly where is the best,1
target nobody knows which mountain we should crime we have to try many things,1
so for that purpose everybody has to think different idea and have to,1
discussion so diversity are including everything gender nationality different,1
culture maybe age you have some very brave young people very brave that's,1
good and each people has more experience and that's very important well to make,1
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?,1
yourself a good scientist I always say first you have to have curiosity if you,1
don't have any curiosity you better choose something else and then we so to,1
be good scientists we have to solve something new so something new usually,1
not easy because it's difficult that why it remains unknown so you need enough,1
courage to tackle this difficult problems and you need a courage and that,1
is a challenge so challenge with courage and I call this three primary see and,1
then once you decide to tackle you have to concentrate and continue,1
and the eventually you build up confidence so this is another three see,1
that's my what I tell to my students I,1
How have you maintained your curiosity?,1
never tried to keep my curiosity it comes from inside when I learned,1
something in you I always oh this is quite interesting but why and curiously,1
just endless it comes from inside,1
Who has most inspired you?,1
well there are civil level as a general science the first incident I was,1
enchanted of charmed by the years Natural Science is the very tiny tiny,1
ring around the Saturn which is watched through the telescope at the elementary,1
school that was first I got very much interested want to be astronomer and I,1
read many books but then later switched the medicine because I read a biography,1
of a Hideo Noguchi and the second very critical moment maybe the time to come,1
back to Japan so I was another big choice in my life whether I stay in,1
United States keep going and many people advised to stay but I,1
decided to go back to Japan that's 74 other kind of turning point in,1
both cases I was very fortunate my decision was,1
correct or correct because I made something retrospectively well for my,1
Was there a specific moment that sparked your interest in science?,1
science I have so many important mentor or advisor the first mentor Osama,1
Hayashi who discovered oxygen gas oxygen directing cooperation into the organic,1
compounds gave my solid background in science and also international fearing,1
science has to be international it's not the local thing and the next person who,1
opened my eye to the molecular minerals is Donald Brown of Carnegie Institution,1
of Washington and without him I never go into this particular field and then I,1
went to very latest laboratory where I actually started this antibody,1
diversification so those three are very important during my scientific career,1
How did you stay focused on your research for all these years?,1
well I didn't have any resistant fortunately my parents very supportive,1
in a very different psychologically and financially they support it and then the,1
my family a wife and children I was kind of work Holly I don't spend much time,1
with my family I feel sorry for them but they just allowed me to concentrate on,1
the my research so I'm very fortunate so playing golf I completely forget about,1
YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a keen golfer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ do you do your best thinking on the golf course?,1
the science and I concentrate but the the reason why I like golf game it's not,1
a competition it's kind of the fight against yourself,1
for example if you hit a bad shot you get angry but you get angry against,1
yourself and always you have to think very carefully because every time you,1
hit the ball run into different conditions sometimes grass thick,1
sometimes you know different weather and you always have to think but it's a,1
different type of challenge but I can completely forget about my science and,1
it's also very enjoyable,1
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement?,1
for scientific career I think I made two major contributions one is the I found,1
the molecular mechanism for the antibody diversity namely antigen induced,1
antibody diversity class switch recombination and somatic mutation and,1
this pd-1 break discovery and its application to cancer immunotherapy but,1
these days I'm still working so I'm very much pleased this of my two lines now,1
coming to very close because can see me no therapy depends Lots on your gut,1
microbiota and gut microbiota regulation depends on IG a secretion and the,1
molecule I discovered for antigen induced memory AI D does I found another,1
important molecule and do two molecules collaborate to maintain our gut,1
microbiota and this is important for homeostasis and also anti-tumor immunity,1
so that's my scientific contribution but for for the person life I had a family,1
and two children fortunately both doing well some is the medical doctor,1
physician and daughter is the embryologist working science field and,1
what's rest I also served the administration in the medical school,1
and I also served as the scientific adviser to the Prime Minister almost 10,1
years ago and I don't know whether I made something through this type of the,1
administrative work but at least I tried to improve scientific environment,1
What was your childhood like?,1
so,1
you know i have uh two brothers and two,1
sisters,1
so um we have a large family and,1
especially when we were young of course,1
that,1
that involved a lot of chaos uh and uh,1
we had a lot of freedom at that time you,1
know,1
children now seem to have very scripted,1
uh lives,1
and whereas we had a lot of freedom uh,1
basically you know,1
you go out of the house in the morning,1
let's say in the summertime and you come,1
back in the evening for dinner,1
um and nobody's expecting to see you in,1
between,1
so um yeah it was uh it was a lot of fun,1
uh to grow up in that kind of an,1
environment,1
Was there a particular teacher that inspired you?,1
for my i would say for my my career,1
inspiration i was very fortunate to have,1
a,1
high school biology teacher dr rose,1
nelson and,1
she was a phd so she had done research,1
had done,1
post doctoral training and um,1
she taught us biology not as a series,1
of you know sort of facts but,1
she would teach us about discoveries and,1
about scientists who made,1
discoveries and the sort of the,1
excitement of,1
of learning something new in science and,1
that really excited me,1
she also recommended to me a summer,1
program,1
at a research institute where i was able,1
to,1
experience research firsthand um and so,1
all those experiences really,1
um really excited me and,1
developed a passion in science that i've,1
had ever since and,1
so i really i really owe that to her and,1
it's it's one of,1
my regrets you know that she passed away,1
before this time because um she was a,1
very,1
uh very positive person and very,1
ambulant,1
joyful um so she always had a beatific,1
smile on her face,1
and and she would uh she would be,1
teaching us something and she would say,1
now i want you to remember that when you,1
win your nobel prize that you learned,1
that here,1
and she said this you know not to me to,1
you know,1
to the class and she would say this as,1
as a statement of fact so i don't know,1
how she knew,1
but she was really a remarkable teacher,1
Why did you become interested in genetics?,1
well i guess you know the idea of of,1
hereditary,1
passing down of traits and how this was,1
determined by sequences within the dna,1
you know it is it's kind of a very uh,1
amazing thing right to go from these,1
molecules to,1
um traits of of of living organisms,1
and that really interested me and uh so,1
i was,1
uh first interested in genetics sort of,1
a basic,1
uh genetics and thought i would do you,1
know sort of basic genetic research,1
uh but while i was in college a family,1
that we knew had a child born with down,1
syndrome,1
and i became interested in medical,1
genetics and decided that,1
i would try to get training both as an,1
md,1
and a phd so that i could do both,1
genetics research and medical,1
genetics as a clinical specialty,1
How do you deal with failure?,1
right well when i was a college student,1
i worked in a lab,1
in boston and the the,1
leader of the lab he would always say,1
search and research,1
because that's the nature of science,1
that um there are always obstacles to be,1
overcome experimentally and um,1
and that's a challenge and if if that,1
isn't something that's enjoyable to you,1
then probably science is not is not a,1
good line of work uh,1
because we're we're constantly uh faced,1
with those kinds of,1
obstacles and challenges and uh,1
you know part of the fun of the work is,1
uh is using our,1
our creativity to come up with solutions,1
to those kinds of problems when they,1
arise,1
persistence is a a very critical uh,1
attribute absolutely and then the other,1
part of it that,1
is very helpful is to have colleagues,1
who take orthogonal approaches,1
to the science so they may look at the,1
science in a slightly different way,1
and and and may provide an avenue,1
for uh circumventing various obstacles,1
um and so when we were trying to um,1
isolate the the dna sequences that,1
uh coded for the uh the subunits of the,1
hypoxia inducible factors,1
we we took one approach uh because we,1
thought that there was only,1
um one one protein that was,1
involved and we took a approach that,1
involved,1
um screening uh human dna sequences in,1
bacteriophage,1
and we screened millions and millions of,1
these uh these clones and we,1
we got negative results um so you know,1
as the leader of the research,1
project it's sort of my role to decide,1
what to do so you know we could um,1
continue,1
doing what we were doing and that didn't,1
seem like a very good idea,1
we could give up and let someone else do,1
it that didn't seem like a very good,1
idea,1
either or we could take a completely,1
different approach which was rather than,1
a molecular genetic approach,1
to take a biochemical approach and try,1
to purify,1
the protein through uh biochemistry,1
and this was not exactly our forte so,1
you know we owned none of the equipment,1
that was required to purify proteins,1
did not really have the expertise to do,1
that uh,1
but fortunately across the street at,1
johns hopkins was the lab of uh,1
tom kelly and his lab was one of the,1
first labs to purify a protein,1
based on its binding to dna and so with,1
the assistance of his lab,1
we were able to do that to purify the,1
protein,1
uh from 100 liters of cells,1
growing in culture and to get just,1
enough of the protein that we could,1
obtain some,1
protein sequence and then use that,1
protein sequence,1
to identify the dna sequences of what,1
turned out to be the two subunits of the,1
protein,1
so in fact the approach that we had been,1
taking would never have worked,1
uh because that approach only works if,1
the protein has a single subunit,1
and because our protein turned out to,1
have two different subunits,1
um only through the purification the,1
biochemical purification,1
uh would we have been able to succeed,1
How important in freedom in science?,1
and,1
you know so again you know the the,1
freedom and the creativity these are the,1
really,1
fun parts of the job that no one no one,1
tells us how to do,1
our work and as long as we're successful,1
you know we're left alone,1
and and we can do our thing um and so,1
to have that freedom to uh not only,1
with regards to you know problem solving,1
but even more fundamentally what,1
questions do we,1
ask you know what what are what are the,1
really important questions that we'd,1
like to answer,1
um that's that's left entirely up to us,1
uh and and obviously that changes over,1
time,1
um and so you know we started with a,1
more with sort of more basic fundamental,1
questions,1
and then uh over time have shifted to,1
more applied,1
uh applications uh as the project has,1
evolved,1
and uh so that's been very satisfying,1
over the course of uh 30 years to be,1
able to connect the dots to very,1
molecular fundamental questions how does,1
a cell,1
sense the oxygen concentration and,1
respond to changes,1
all the way to you know can we develop,1
new treatments for anemia for cancer for,1
cardiovascular disease,1
and you know as someone trained both in,1
research,1
and medicine you know for me it's always,1
i've always felt it was my role to,1
bridge between the basic science,1
and the and the clinical translation and,1
so you know it's been very satisfying to,1
reach that point,1
where um uh we we see these,1
uh translations occurring now uh as a,1
result of these basic discoveries that,1
were made,1
25 years ago,1
Have you ever doubted yourself?,1
that's a good question um,1
well i guess i yeah i doubt myself often,1
um you know i often doubt uh you know i,1
might am i taking the,1
the the best approach uh uh,1
am i uh running the lab most efficiently,1
um and uh you know am i uh,1
am i mentoring my students well enough,1
could i be doing a better job at that so,1
yeah i i,1
i guess i have those kind of doubts or,1
self-criticism,1
on a fairly regular basis,1
How did you discover you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?,1
well i was uh i think the word is,1
dumbfounded,1
so uh you know it was of course in the,1
us it was the middle of the night,1
and uh i was sleeping very soundly and,1
the phone rang,1
and uh well you know when i finally was,1
uh awoken,1
out of the sleep and got to the phone in,1
the hallway,1
it had stopped ringing so you know again,1
i was not even really awake yet and i,1
figured well maybe this is somebody's,1
idea of a bad joke you know because i,1
didn't know what day it was,1
um so i went back to sleep and uh,1
actually quite a while later the phone,1
rang again i said perhaps i better be,1
quicker this time so i got to the phone,1
and uh you know thomas perlman,1
apologized for waking me up and then you,1
know gave the good news and,1
you know i i was sort of on the phone,1
and uh you know my jaw just dropped and,1
i didn't really words weren't coming out,1
and of course my wife was there uh and,1
she could hear what,1
was being said on the phone and her jaw,1
dropped and she couldn't say,1
save much either so we were just kind of,1
mute it was a very one-sided,1
conversation,1
Can you explain your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery?,1
well you know everybody appreciates the,1
importance of oxygen right i mean you,1
just have to hold your breath,1
and you'll start feeling uncomfortable,1
very soon right because you have a,1
hundred trillion cells in your body,1
and they all need oxygen on a continuous,1
basis,1
uh you know principally to make energy,1
which,1
allows us to you know for this complex,1
organism,1
to function right and the body uses uh,1
glucose and oxygen in order to generate,1
energy,1
and so there has to be but by the same,1
token,1
oxygen at two higher levels causes,1
damage,1
to cells so the the there has to be a,1
very,1
tight coordination between supply and,1
demand,1
so the the amount of oxygen that each,1
cell requires,1
uh has to be matched by the delivery of,1
oxygen which is of course carried by red,1
blood cells,1
through the blood vessels to each cell,1
and,1
so so there's a beautiful you know,1
physiological system that maintains the,1
balance,1
between consumption and delivery of,1
oxygen,1
in every one of the 100 trillion cells,1
in your body under um normal healthy,1
conditions,1
uh and of course that balance is,1
disturbed,1
by many common diseases including,1
cardiovascular disease and cancer,1
[Music],1
What practical applications does your work have?,1
yes so you know the first uh translation,1
of the discovery of this system to the,1
clinic,1
is uh the development of new drugs for,1
the treatment of anemia,1
so we started by studying uh,1
the hormone that controls red blood cell,1
production called erythropoietin or,1
epo uh and uh uh,1
patients who have a chronic kidney,1
disease the kidneys stop,1
making ippo and they become anemic and,1
the discovery of epa was a revolution,1
because it,1
enabled the patients to receive a,1
recombinant epo protein as an,1
injection to stimulate red blood cell,1
production,1
but of course uh it's a recombinant,1
protein,1
and it has to be injected and uh now,1
there are in development uh,1
uh drugs that uh induce the activity,1
of the uh the factors that we identified,1
the hypoxia inducible factors that,1
control epo production and these drugs,1
can be given as pills by mouth,1
so that um,1
the the treatment of anemia can be,1
you know made much more convenient for,1
patients both with kidney disease and,1
other causes,1
of anemia and there are you know four,1
different,1
drugs that are all in advanced clinical,1
trials now over,1
25 000 patients are are being,1
studied in these trials uh and uh one of,1
the drugs has already been,1
approved for use in china and japan,1
and you know will probably be approved,1
in the u.s and europe within the next,1
year or so,1
if you know if if everything goes well,1
so that'll be the first,1
um application of our discoveries to the,1
clinic,1
uh uh another area so,1
you know in in that context uh the the,1
hypoxia inducible factors,1
are uh as i said play an important role,1
in in physiology,1
and uh when they're not be when they're,1
not produced in sufficient amounts we,1
would like to stimulate that,1
but in cancer the factors are produced,1
at very high amounts because,1
oxygen becomes very limiting in cancers,1
because the,1
the cells grow so rapidly that they,1
basically,1
outgrow their blood supply and become,1
very hypoxic,1
and uh and this can lead in fact to the,1
the cancer cells dying because they,1
don't have enough,1
oxygen which of course you'd say what's,1
bad,1
about that it you know that's what we,1
like cancer cells to do to die,1
but of course the cells that are very,1
far away,1
die but those that are closer they can,1
survive,1
but their exposure to low oxygen changes,1
them,1
makes them more invasive and metastatic,1
more difficult to kill and uh and,1
and we believe these cells are are,1
really,1
cells that are very dangerous in terms,1
of the risk of,1
the cancer spreading through the body,1
and resisting therapy,1
and pretty much all of the cancer,1
therapies are targeted to the,1
cells around blood vessels that have,1
lots of oxygen that are rapidly dividing,1
uh whereas the hypoxic cells,1
are not really targeted by any therapy,1
and we think that,1
if we can inhibit the activity of the,1
hypoxia inducible factors,1
in the hypoxic area of the cancers that,1
that will complement the existing,1
therapies,1
and lead to you know a better outcome,1
for patients with,1
advanced cancer and uh so,1
there's a uh a hip inhibitor that's now,1
in clinical trials for kidney cancer,1
um so i think we you know we've already,1
started down that road as well,1
when i say we i mean the the scientific,1
community and the pharmaceutical,1
industry,1
recognizing the importance of this area,1
for targeting in different diseases,1
Is there a good balance between basic and applied research in medicine today?,1
most applied research,1
comes from a foundation of basic,1
research,1
and what i mean by that is that the,1
basic studies are often done,1
just trying to understand a system and,1
and the properties of that system,1
without directly saying we want to,1
target this particular disease because,1
that tends to be less effective,1
than to say let's just learn about the,1
system,1
and by doing so over time it'll become,1
apparent how we might target the system,1
therapeutically,1
uh and so really that's uh that's how we,1
started just,1
with very basic fundamental research um,1
and and it's led now to i think many,1
applications,1
being apparent that that again will take,1
time,1
to unfold but will hopefully result in,1
new treatments for a number of different,1
Diseases,1
How did your upbringing influence your path to science?,1
my upbringing,1
possibly shaped me as a scientist mostly,1
because i was fortunate,1
i did not influence this i was fortunate,1
to be born,1
into a family which was,1
relatively mindful compared with many,1
american families which are mindless,1
my parents who were not at all,1
scientists,1
but nonetheless they were well educated,1
they graduated from college during the,1
depression,1
which was very rare for american adults,1
and then they got as is often the case,1
when you,1
achieve an education they got mindful,1
jobs,1
my father was a newspaper reporter my,1
mother was a school teacher,1
these are these are white-collar jobs,1
not,1
labor and so the atmosphere in the home,1
was,1
relatively mindful without being yelled,1
at by my parents to,1
do well in school or something it was,1
just a good atmosphere which to,1
be raised and that made me realize,1
when i was a baby that school,1
education is not torture it's,1
interesting,1
it's not just a chore a daily chore,1
and i really liked my science courses in,1
high school for example,1
and that made me,1
interested in going on to college to try,1
to become a physician a doctor,1
but halfway through college i lost,1
interest in that,1
totally but,1
in many american colleges if you want to,1
become a physician,1
an md you major in uh,1
you say we major that's a verb you major,1
in biology,1
that's what i was doing so i just stayed,1
in biology,1
no more pre-med interest and i just,1
decided to go on in biology,1
after college but,1
all of this did go back to being in an,1
atmosphere my father,1
for instance taught me sports,1
and we went to many sports matches,1
of many kinds that was very interesting,1
i spent way too much time,1
wallowing in sports but he told me i'll,1
never forget it one morning he said,1
will you stop going to the sports pages,1
in the morning paper,1
initially every morning read the front,1
of the paper,1
sometimes for for example,1
to not just to be a typical american,1
adolescent teenager where you're a,1
you know boasting about the fact that,1
you don't know anything and that school,1
is is ridiculous,1
and not cool so,1
that that's what influenced me to,1
i mean when if you're a researcher in,1
science without necessarily boasting,1
it it's a mindful occupation you have to,1
know things you have to learn,1
about factors and phenomena and,1
technology,1
it's very valuable to read,1
what we call the literature in your,1
field to,1
not just to keep up but because it's,1
often interesting,1
and and so this so i had a,1
similar vocational experience to my,1
parents,1
who for a total of almost 100 years of,1
time had mindful jobs,1
obviously if you're a journalist you're,1
not,1
cutting down trees in a forest it's not,1
physical labor,1
it's it's words and ideas and,1
events and same with a schoolteacher my,1
mother taught english,1
Do you think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to have a mentor?,1
i i found it,1
to have a mentor which i had two,1
crucial mentors in my time i was very,1
fortunate,1
i didn't realize at the time how lucky i,1
was i had a mentor in college,1
uh which there was that's very rare that,1
mentoring even in the old days was,1
in colleges very low level,1
stuff but this guy was a genuine mentor,1
he was a,1
very well-regarded researcher nationally,1
and even internationally,1
but nobody at the college knew that he,1
was ridiculed,1
because he could not be a member of the,1
regular faculty,1
because he had gone deaf as a young man,1
in the 1930s,1
he was a graduate student in this this,1
is relevant to this year's nobel prize,1
he was a graduate student working under,1
alfred sturdivant,1
who in turn worked under thomas hunt,1
morgan,1
the first drosophilas to receive the,1
nobel prize i didn't know this,1
at the time but he was,1
i was doing a little research project,1
under this man his name was,1
phil ives and instead of,1
solely instructing us how to do the,1
project which is trivial,1
undergraduate he also,1
self-consciously told the people working,1
under him a small number of students he,1
was not permitted to teach classes,1
he was just a researcher and he was,1
regarded very poorly everybody said you,1
have this job,1
as a charity because you went to that,1
college when you were younger and you,1
grew up in the town,1
in the middle of massachusetts and usc,1
and they said you got a charity,1
acceptance to the college,1
and then you got later a charity job,1
because you were deaf,1
and nobody would hire you for the,1
standard,1
phd biology job and so he was looked,1
down upon,1
very minor character ostensibly in this,1
biology,1
department as it was called but he was,1
the,1
about the only one actually doing any,1
research but he was,1
superb at,1
uh cranking up enthusiasm and motivation,1
for the small number of students working,1
under him doing,1
minor research projects but also he said,1
i want to teach you,1
all you students you trio or quartet,1
what he called the lore of drosophila,1
how it all started where and how when,1
which went back to his academic,1
grandfather who was,1
by then the famed thomas hunt morgan the,1
first drosophilas to be awarded the,1
noble who would have ever imagined,1
morgan himself when he started in 1908,1
09 1910 would never have imagined that,1
their genetics findings,1
would come to be regarded as so,1
so significant which they were,1
and he was the boss even though he,1
the people who knew morgan knew that he,1
didn't wasn't really very good at what,1
he was doing,1
but the boss gets awarded the prize,1
not not the,1
actual researchers who is a famed trio,1
of his students who are some of the best,1
biologists in the history of biology,1
sturdivant mueller who won the nobel,1
prize in the 40s,1
and then there was a calvin bridges,1
another superb geneticist,1
everything that the three awardees this,1
year have done,1
we could have done none of it ever if it,1
hadn't been for those three,1
drosophilas working under morgan morgan,1
was such a flake,1
that he he started studying fruit flies,1
because he wanted to study,1
cell biology and development not,1
genetics,1
he never heard of genetics very few had,1
at the time,1
[Music],1
What sparked your curiosity about our daily biological clocks?,1
it was that what sparked my interest,1
this is a,1
another remarkable coincidence which,1
i would have never was strange and very,1
helpful,1
in retrospect uh when i was a,1
taking a course in college,1
one of the teachers in the course,1
had was a wet behind the ears assistant,1
professor,1
as we say he just started a faculty job,1
he went from his phd work at princeton,1
in new jersey,1
immediately to a faculty job that was,1
common at the time,1
later you had to do postdoctoral,1
research for two,1
four not typically five seven years,1
before you can get a faculty job he went,1
straight from his phd,1
and so what well the so what with that,1
he had worked on drosophila,1
rhythms for his phd under a then famous,1
rhythm researcher this was not genetics,1
it was just rhythmic biology,1
and so this guy was teaching a course on,1
evolution,1
about which he knew nothing it was not,1
in his background,1
so he put into this course on evolution,1
a module,1
about drosophila rhythms be,1
out of desperation but it was very,1
interesting,1
it was not germane to the course he,1
still works at that college and i,1
became much more close with him,1
professionally and,1
personally later on and i talked about i,1
said,1
his name is bill zimmerman i said bill,1
i don't know if you were doing more than,1
you knew to us students when you were,1
teaching us about rhythms,1
but it was nonetheless just,1
intrinsically,1
interesting so i started to learn about,1
daily rhythms which i never heard of and,1
one way to learn about daily rhythms,1
in animals or anything is via the early,1
days of fruit fly research,1
studying rhythms albeit not genetically,1
but then after,1
college and then after grad school i,1
i went to caltech to be a postdoctoral,1
because that was becoming,1
more and more necessary and one of my,1
lab mates was the person who started the,1
entire,1
genetic approach to studying rhythms he,1
was a grad,1
student there in that lab at caltech and,1
and i got to know him very well because,1
we had personal,1
interests that overlapped,1
in rock and roll music and profanity and,1
beer drinking and,1
but in addition he had done this phd,1
thesis,1
research on rhythm on genetic,1
taking a genetic approach to study daily,1
rhythms and i perked up because it was,1
superb research,1
as such but also i i understood,1
what he was doing and why because i had,1
by a pure,1
coincidence been exposed to rhythmic,1
phenomenon,1
a few years before in drosophila there,1
there's a drosophila,1
species called drosophila melanogaster,1
that's the species which is studied,1
in such a heavily genetic manner which,1
has led to five nobel prizes,1
melanogaster but there's another,1
there's many drosophila species and one,1
of them believe it or not is called,1
drosophila,1
pseudo-obscura it's only pseudo obscure,1
apparently,1
and it's the species that was used going,1
back to the,1
middle of the previous century and,1
before,1
the species used to study rhythms,1
although not genetically,1
because you can't there's not much,1
genetic background,1
involving pseudo obscure it's all,1
melanogaster that's the species that,1
morgan,1
lab pioneered and started to generate,1
all this,1
genetic information and genetic,1
materials,1
there's more known about drosophila,1
melanogaster,1
than the sum total of all genetic,1
knowledge,1
about any organisms any and all,1
organisms,1
and of course the genomics is completely,1
known in drosophila melanogaster,1
that's the species they chose to do,1
genomics,1
in terms of fruit flies because there's,1
so much,1
additional genetic knowledge going back,1
more than 100 years,1
nobody uh uh nobody knows this nobody,1
needs to know but,1
morgan somebody at morgan celeb noticed,1
an anatomical anomaly for one individual,1
fly back in 19,1
before just before 1910 some people,1
claim it's the famed white eye mutant,1
that's false it was a mutant on the back,1
end of the fly which had an,1
anomalous slightly anomalous appearance,1
it was a mutant called with which says,1
nothing,1
and that's long disappeared nobody,1
studied it much the white eye mutant,1
became,1
famously studied by morgan,1
himself and especially his students,1
in fact one reason that the first clock,1
gene,1
that was identified molecularly could be,1
identified was because it is located,1
very near the white gene and that part,1
of the,1
fruit fly genome in melanogaster is one,1
of the most,1
heavily studied subsets of the genome,1
there's vast amounts of genetic,1
knowledge,1
about it which permitted it to be,1
isolated molecularly,1
so this is another example of how,1
our predecessors unbeknownst to them at,1
the time and unbeknownst,1
to us when we were doing it we couldn't,1
have done anything,1
without all this background,1
Is circadian rhythm a sort of sixth sense for living on earth?,1
we're not aware of all of our senses,1
we're aware of,1
sights and sounds and visual inputs,1
we're not aware of another sense which,1
is the sense of balance,1
which is a mediated by sensory,1
and central nervous system and by a,1
loose analogy,1
what you said about rhythmicity being,1
something of a sixth sense we're unaware,1
of our daily fluctuations most of them,1
but they seem because they're so,1
widespread,1
for a given organism and among organisms,1
they're so ubiquitous that they seem as,1
if they must be,1
important and it must have been,1
important for life,1
when it arose on this planet over three,1
billion years ago,1
to cope with,1
the location of this body in the solar,1
system,1
some people and many scientists are,1
aware of,1
the revolution of the earth and changes,1
in,1
seasonal changes and also the rotation,1
of the earth,1
which creates these relentless 24-hour,1
cycles,1
and and so to cope with mostly,1
fluctuations between light and darkness,1
which occurs in most parts,1
of the earth all year except like in,1
northern sweden,1
um but some people say wait a minute,1
these are changes in the seasons i say,1
yeah but the cycles are still,1
24 hours yes there's different amounts,1
of darkness,1
in the winter compared with the summer,1
like here when it gets dark at three,1
there are 1500 should have it,1
but it's still a 24-hour cycle and it's,1
relentless,1
and so it seemed as if to cope with,1
these relentless environmental cycles,1
that the origin of life had to so code,1
Did the universality of clock genes pave the way to the discovery?,1
[Music],1
that's a cavalier argument that can be,1
made,1
about the fact that the clock genes and,1
clock,1
mechanisms are so similar,1
from microbes to mammals which is,1
one of the consequences of our,1
kick starting a molecular genetic,1
approach,1
which then people are found similar my,1
god these fruit flight clock genes are,1
everywhere,1
and there's not 700 of them per species,1
there's maybe a dozen core clock genes,1
that's tractable that can be figured out,1
knock himself when he was finding his,1
he found three remarkable mutants out of,1
two thousand tries,1
that's better than zero but what if he,1
found,1
four 400 what do you how do you cope,1
with,1
this avalanche of novel,1
it was just three tractable,1
and that's how the whole clock molecular,1
genetics,1
story unfolded he said it is a,1
crucial uh dozen or so,1
low double figures worth of clock,1
factors,1
genes and their products which are,1
proteins which are acting and,1
interacting,1
to form and operate the daily clock in,1
cells,1
including ourselves including especially,1
in our brain,1
so this was we are fortunate to study a,1
phenomenon which is a,1
interesting and be tractable,1
what if we were going to have to deal,1
with a network of,1
hundreds of interacting genes we would,1
be,1
floundering around for decades and but,1
we could,1
platform my god when mike mike young who,1
did,1
amongst the best work we all put our,1
findings together we said my god you,1
know we have something like,1
70 mutants but,1
and they could define 70 genes which is,1
a nightmare,1
but the 60 70 mutants defined,1
10 genes that means when you,1
hit a gene and get a novel rhythm,1
problem with your new mutant it's a gene,1
that which was hit before,1
and he said wow,1
and that's that's just a good fortune,1
because we didn't set up the,1
organisms to be that way we had to find,1
out if that was the case which we did,1
all along the way finding out more than,1
we ever intended,1
but the whole thing was just extremely,1
good fortune all the way back to when,1
this guy,1
taught me about rhythms because he,1
didn't know anything about evolution,1
which was the course,1
[Music],1
How would you describe your collaboration with Michael Rosbash?,1
well we were we met,1
in the middle of the 1970s shortly,1
before he came to,1
brandeis university i had already come,1
there,1
a short time before we met he was going,1
to join the faculty one about one half,1
year after i did,1
and he came to meet me when he made a,1
trip,1
to kind of help him gear up to start his,1
job a little later,1
and he came to meet me i never heard of,1
him he was just a post-doc,1
nobody's ever heard of those people and,1
he,1
told me that he was coming to brandeis,1
to do research in molecular biology,1
study populations of dnas and rnas,1
rnas being the primary gene products and,1
i knew about that kind of research,1
because i had been instructed about it,1
when i was in grad school,1
i found it very interesting and so it,1
wasn't like he said i'm going to study,1
this,1
and i might have said in another,1
situation,1
i don't know what you're talking about i,1
don't care go away,1
no i said oh that's interesting i'm i'm,1
glad there's going to be somebody on the,1
faculty doing that work,1
and he said well i hear that you work on,1
fruit fly genetics,1
and behavior genetics and neurogenetics,1
i said yes that's what i'm trying to,1
start doing,1
he said well but none of that's,1
molecular i said no,1
of course not it can't be it was the mid,1
70s,1
he said but maybe we maybe we could join,1
forces,1
later in life and,1
merge my molecular expertise with your,1
genetic biological neural behavior,1
i said sure let's pencil that in,1
for eight years,1
astoundingly we did,1
start to work together in the early mid,1
80s as he,1
imagined but at the time when he,1
proposed this upcoming conceivable,1
scenario,1
it did not and could not have had,1
anything to do with,1
anything particular but what we mutually,1
decided to do was to join forces to work,1
on rhythms,1
genetically and molecularly um,1
but along the way we were fortunate we,1
we got to be fairly close as colleagues,1
and friends,1
because this is similar to me in the,1
great ron konopka,1
ross fish and i had similar outside,1
interests,1
especially sports and especially,1
profane misbehavior which we did,1
often in the planned ways and thought it,1
was very funny nobody else did,1
we did and sometimes spontaneous,1
misbehavior and uh and pop music,1
and getting together in groups and to,1
carouse and drink beer and watch sports,1
and movies and,1
and so along the way in the through the,1
70s into the early 80s,1
we couldn't help occasionally mention,1
to each other about research related,1
matters,1
that had to do with his interest and my,1
interest and i,1
i couldn't help mention to anybody that,1
i knew about,1
konopka's incredible breakthrough in,1
in the caltech which i knew about,1
and i've gotten to know konopka quite,1
well personally,1
but neither raspberry at the time 70s,1
had,1
any interest in doing these things,1
anything having to do with canopicas,1
genetic what we call chronogenetic,1
discovery,1
taking a genetic approach to study,1
rhythms and,1
potentially to study the clockworks,1
which happened and nobody even knocked,1
himself couldn't have imagined that,1
where it would go 80s and beyond,1
in part because kanopka left science,1
prematurely,1
retired when he was in his 40s of all,1
things,1
but anyway so when we decided to work,1
together we had a personal connection,1
and rash himself couldn't everybody,1
would agree that what konopka had,1
done and found was fascinating we said,1
let's,1
springboard off that which is what mike,1
young independently did the same thing,1
young knew about kenobi's discovery,1
back in this late 70s when he was a grad,1
student,1
and he independently said gee if this,1
rhythm genetic biblity boo is going to,1
really,1
mean something more broadly,1
more broadly based and deeper it's got,1
to go molecular,1
it can't be just mutants and rhythmic,1
attributes alone it's got to go,1
molecular which is correct,1
i mean every imaginable i mean jesus the,1
nobel prize awarded to drosophilas in,1
the mid-90s this,1
stemmed from mutants but it was because,1
those,1
mutants pointed to genes which went,1
molecular,1
that those three were awarded the nobel,1
prize,1
they went molecular in fruit flies and,1
then people used those,1
molecular materials to found that there,1
were similar genes,1
all over the place and that's why the,1
work of those three drosophilas,1
became so significant,1
involving work that they didn't even do,1
but they promoted,1
in starting with this humble little,1
insect and that's the same thing in the,1
rhythm business,1
our the clock genes identified in,1
drosophila,1
people now were starting automatically,1
without even thinking about it looking,1
for molecular relatives,1
in other like mammals and not expecting,1
to find them maybe they didn't even want,1
to find out what they did,1
so our work became much more significant,1
than we would have ever,1
imagined at least in part thanks to the,1
work of others,1
who went to school on our findings and,1
materials,1
i i found it a privilege to study,1
rhythms because they're so interesting,1
they just,1
are for i think for anybody,1
that lots of science is gibberish,1
rhythms are not to go to work we were,1
trying to do,1
serious rhythm studies on a given day,1
but,1
in the back of our minds if we had any,1
minds was that,1
this is just enjoyable to study,1
something that,1
is truly interesting biological clocks,1
daily rhythms every day all day and the,1
next day and the next and the next and,1
the next,1
and it the more i got into rhythm,1
research the more i realize that they're,1
universal,1
every category of organism has,1
biological clocks so,1
and some phenomenon of course,1
are limited only to certain types of,1
organisms,1
they're esoteric rhythms are not,1
Necessary,1
Official interview with Svante,1
foreign,1
Where does your passion for science come from?,1
for science come from so I,1
really don't know where my passion from,1
science comes from I think my initial,1
passion was much more for ancient,1
history or archeology here in Sweden,1
where I grew up and for egyptology where,1
my mom took after my mom took me to,1
Egypt when I was 13 or 14 years old and,1
then later I came to science and,1
realized that one could fuse aspects of,1
science with this interest for our past,1
both historical past events and,1
evolutionary paths,1
Was there a particular person that influenced you?,1
was there a particular person who,1
influenced you,1
so I think the person that was most,1
important to me when I grew up was,1
clearly my mother since I grew up alone,1
with my mother in a suburb of Stockholm,1
and I think what was very important was,1
that she well she had a sort of great,1
respect and passion for school work and,1
learning and she took my nerdy interests,1
very seriously when I got interested in,1
ancient Vikings or so she took me to the,1
museum she would take me around to look,1
at runic Stones around the Stockholm and,1
measure them right up what was on them,1
and so on and then she took me to Egypt,1
and where I discovered sort of,1
fascination of with ancient Egypt and I,1
think,1
one thing that also my mother gave me,1
was probably sort of taking life as it,1
comes because she had of course been,1
uprooted by the second world war in,1
Estonia and had to flee to Sweden and,1
arrived here in 44 when she was 18 years,1
old or 19. and many many of her,1
classmates did not survive the war,1
so I think a little bit she took,1
sort of every day as a gift as I think,1
all of us should do actually,1
"How important are teachers, and a good learning environment?",1
how important to teachers and a good,1
learning environment,1
so I grew up in Burger Boston uh,1
part of Stockholm where one at that time,1
at least was not necessarily expected to,1
go to university and I think it were a,1
few teachers for example that was were,1
quite important to me I remember a,1
teacher of physics at Paris who,1
also noticed my interest in ancient,1
things and would even he collected,1
Antiquities and took your summer long,1
and showed me at a school for example,1
and this thing of feeling that your,1
interest was taken seriously by your,1
teachers was quite important,1
yes and I think it's important in a more,1
research setting I think to try to have,1
an atmosphere where everybody in the,1
team can have ideas that they bring in,1
that you're not afraid of saying,1
something stupid or so that you,1
realize that nine of ten ideas that come,1
are probably wrong and stupid but in,1
order to get that tense idea that's,1
really brilliant you have to have an,1
atmosphere where all the things are,1
brought to the table all ideas are,1
expressed,1
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?,1
teased you need to be a successful,1
scientist,1
that it was hard to say what do you need,1
to be a successful scientist because,1
there are if you want many different,1
things that you need to come together,1
perhaps and they're also very different,1
ways to being a successful scientist,1
there are some people that are extremely,1
smart for example and that is important,1
there are other people that are very,1
knowledgeable and really learn from what,1
other people are done there are people,1
that bring together combinations of,1
knowledge that otherwise no one brings,1
together that can be very fruitful I,1
think one cool thing with science,1
actually is that there's not just one,1
way to be a good scientist,1
What do you enjoy about science?,1
what do you enjoy about science,1
well then if you then think about,1
science it's of course driven I think by,1
questions and interests you have for,1
example to sort of see if we can go back,1
in time and see how our genomes or DNA,1
sequences have changed over time,1
but then once you Endeavor on that of,1
course science is is a collective effort,1
so it's very much a social thing where,1
you work in a group try to assemble the,1
people with different competences and,1
make sure that these people get along,1
with each other and that one can,1
together sort of work towards a goal and,1
that's in a way what I find probably,1
most stimulating every day is,1
this going together after something,1
How are competition and collaboration related?,1
how a competition and collaboration,1
related and then many people talk about,1
competition in science and in some sense,1
I don't think that that's,1
an important factor it's a human,1
Enterprise competition comes into it of,1
course but it's not the driving force,1
for us I think it's really going after a,1
question and competing with yourself in,1
a way trying to do is as well and as,1
quickly of course as you can,1
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?,1
to a student,1
student,1
and it's sort of hard to say what advice,1
would you give to,1
the younger scientists that enter the,1
field I think following your passion and,1
your interests is important because it's,1
generally automatically the case that if,1
you're really interested in something,1
you tend to do it well just because you,1
put in a lot of effort because you find,1
it really interesting so you should,1
follow the things that you are,1
interested in then at least you have a,1
good time while you do it what's to say,1
How do you cope with failure?,1
how do you cope with failure and of,1
course there are sort of many challenges,1
and failures and setbacks on the way,1
I think if you hold your sort of gaze on,1
what you want to achieve you can sort of,1
overcome that rather rapidly because,1
generally start thinking about the next,1
experiment what can you do to sort of,1
and you always live in the Grand,1
Illusion that the next thing will solve,1
everything that you do,1
What are the key implications of your research?,1
what are the key implications of your,1
research and our research is then,1
curiosity driven if you like we want to,1
find out what happened to our ancestors,1
in the past,1
so we have been able to study the,1
genomes of our closest evolutionary,1
relatives neanderthals and we discovered,1
distant relatives and Neanderthals that,1
lived in Asia the Denis Evans and found,1
that they contributed to the gene pool,1
of people today that many people today,1
if your roots are outside Africa carry,1
genetic variants that come from these,1
earlier forms of humans and that these,1
variants genetic variants influence our,1
biology today influence our,1
susceptibility to disease or our sense,1
of pain or many other things,1
What's the relationship of Neandertals to modern humans?,1
what's the relationship of Neanderthals,1
to modern humans and of course now when,1
we have the genome our closest,1
evolutionary relative,1
we can sort of look for genetic changes,1
that are unique to neanderthals and that,1
are unique to fully modern humans that,1
happen in our ancestors during the last,1
half million years and spread to,1
everybody almost everybody today so we,1
can have this catalog of sort of the,1
genetic changes that make our genome,1
unique,1
and a research direction that is now,1
becoming very exciting is to try to,1
understand which of these may have,1
functional consequences,1
which of these changes May influence,1
things such as why modern humans became,1
millions and eventually billions of,1
people spread over the entire planet to,1
spread over open Oceans Where You Don't,1
See land on the other side and came to a,1
point today where we influence much of,1
the biosphere actually,1
What makes us uniquely human?,1
what makes us uniquely human,1
can of course asks what makes modern,1
humors unique and that is these things I,1
think that we and not these other forms,1
of humans became very numerous started,1
having technology and culture that,1
changed very rapidly and and became so,1
numerous that we probably just absorbed,1
these earlier forms into our population,1
at least that's probably a large,1
part of why neanderthals for example,1
disappeared we are beginning to learn,1
so I think the really big question is to,1
understand in the future what that may,1
have been it could have been even,1
something more about sociality that we,1
have the ability to form big societies,1
and transmit much of our knowledge to,1
the Next Generation that in reality,1
humans are quite unique in that we spend,1
almost the first third of Our Lives,1
absorbing all the knowledge that,1
previous generations have generated and,1
then we build on that so some people,1
talk about this ratchet effect that in,1
each generation we sort of develop our,1
culture and Technology further so I,1
think somewhere there is probably in the,1
future going to be the key what's that,1
modern humans apart so much,1
How did you celebrate the news of your Nobel Prize?,1
how did you celebrate the news of your,1
Nobel Prize when there was an,1
announcement of this at the beginning of,1
October it was a great surprise to me I,1
must say,1
and was a surprise I think to many,1
people in our Institute and to many,1
people in in the field I think it feels,1
so good also because it's sort of a,1
recognition of this entire research,1
field,1
um and yes there was a lot of,1
celebrations also in the Institute,1
immediately actually taking place and it,1
was amazing how many people take who,1
wrote to me people from far back in my,1
life that took this as an occasion to,1
contact me again and that was a lot of,1
fun how is it returning to Stockholm to,1
"How is it, returning to Stockholm to receive the prize?",1
receive the prize,1
what should I say emotional to be back,1
in the city that I grew up in,1
unfortunate to say my mother is not,1
around anymore to experience this and,1
it's of course a sort of amazing feeling,1
also to realize that exactly 40 years,1
ago my father received the same price,1
here,1
foreign,1
[Music],1
Will anything special happen when you return to Germany?,1
will anything special happen when you,1
return to Germany,1
well and so when I have survived this,1
week here we will have a party for for,1
the institute at the oldest techno club,1
in East Germany actually which is not,1
far from our Institute The Distillery in,1
leichtig,1
What environments help with creativity?,1
what environments help with creativity,1
an amazing thing in my career I've been,1
the opportunity that came in the mid 90s,1
to take part in the founding of this new,1
Max Planck Institute in Leipzig in East,1
Germany,1
and there was a chance to think about,1
how should one create an Institute and,1
how should one do anthropology in the,1
future,1
so the question that we sort of United,1
The Institute from many many disciplines,1
that moved there was around what makes,1
humans unique in different genetically,1
biologically behaviorally and so on,1
and it was also a chance to create a,1
building and an environment to bring,1
people together,1
and of course science is very,1
International many people come from all,1
over the world to work with us and have,1
much of their life in the Institute so I,1
think it's also seen very important to,1
sort of have things like a sound on the,1
roof or a climbing wall or things you,1
can do together things that are not,1
about the science that you can do,1
together to bring people,1
to talk to each other all to people from,1
different disciplines that work in,1
different departments why is diversity,1
Why is diversity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of all kinds -in science important?,1
of all kinds important in science often,1
what is important for the progress of,1
science is to bring different,1
perspectives and opinions together that,1
can be very useful to bring people with,1
different backgrounds and experiences,1
together it's often in the sort of,1
combination of disciplines and,1
knowledges that new things emerge that,1
said I think it's very important that,1
each individual is very rooted,1
in their own area of expertise and then,1
interact with other fields so to say,1
they have to be expert in something to,1
appreciate what the other people do can,1
Can you tell us about the object that you are donating to the Nobel Prize Museum?,1
you tell us about the object that you're,1
donating to the Nobel Prize Museum they,1
of course want you to donate some object,1
to the Nobel Prize Museum here,1
and after some thought I decided to give,1
them two books sort of dictionaries of,1
science that my father gave me in 1971,1
when I decided to not study science in,1
in school and rather go for Latin and,1
ancient things it was a little,1
disappointed with that and gave me these,1
books I think to sort of say I should,1
keep at least an ion science still,1
so they sort of remind me about that yes,1
that happened I did come back to science,1
and it's sort of a little link back to,1
my dad also,1
Foreign,1
Did you always plan on studying medicine?,1
I can remember the day of choosing,1
medicine the headmaster rather austere,1
figure came into the chemistry classroom,1
and said Ratcliffe could I have a word,1
and I followed her out of the classroom,1
he said Radcliffe I think he should,1
study medicine he wasn't the sort of guy,1
you challenged so I said yes sir and,1
that's what we did we struck out,1
chemistry and wrote medicine on the,1
University forms and that's where I,1
ended up in medicine I've liked it,1
although we never quite knew whether he,1
thought I would be bad chemist good,1
chemist or about doctor and to be,1
perfectly clear I don't think we know,1
that now well I think medicine has so,1
What do you enjoy about medicine?,1
many facets I've done several of them,1
I've worked in in research in Discovery,1
Science as you know and that's why I'm,1
here today but that wasn't my medical,1
part I trained as a kidney specialist,1
I've done a lot of acute diagnostic,1
medicine that's quite fascinating quite,1
challenging I enjoyed that bedside,1
teaching of medical students I think,1
it's a breadth of of Medicine that,1
that's so fascinating there's the,1
science of course is quite a different,1
way of life and I had the great good,1
fortune of being able to practice,1
medicine and be a scientist,1
How do you deal with failures?,1
we're just carrying on I'd have to,1
correct the first people have asked me,1
were there you Rica moments in your work,1
there were there were several they were,1
not sheer brilliance they were stumbling,1
around and eventually recognizing that,1
something that had been actually almost,1
obvious was there before you in biology,1
I'm not talking about chemistry physics,1
they're quite different subjects but,1
biology is is very complicated you're,1
made by Darwinian evolution you're not,1
actually a logical way of doing what you,1
do you are fit for purpose so it doesn't,1
help to be terribly clever to be,1
absolutely brilliant to do be terribly,1
logical just have to do experiments and,1
observe the results and draw your simple,1
conclusions from those experiments that,1
that's what we do well I someone was,1
Did anyone influence you?,1
very kind to me and the start of all,1
this was to David whether all I had a,1
slightly unusual entry to this I I I'm a,1
physician I trained as a physician and I,1
had this idea to work on erythropoietin,1
which is a little bit unusual that was,1
very important because it's a relatively,1
small field and that I needed someone I,1
needed an institute I needed an,1
infrastructure which actually knew about,1
molecular biology and David Weatherall,1
and also John Bell who had one of the,1
labs in David's Institute very kindly,1
taught me the technology that was,1
necessary for the molecular approach to,1
erythropoietin regulation so there were,1
very important people I did just qualify,1
the the the the word mentor they the the,1
people were helpful were those who built,1
confidence now in some respects a mentor,1
is someone who might guide you to the,1
right field or the right area I don't,1
think that's very good because it,1
almost certainly will guide you to fill,1
this already occupied by others so,1
they're really helpful people are those,1
give you the confidence but allow either,1
completely free choice that was,1
important to me that people were kind to,1
me in that way I think it's a I've had a,1
What would you say to a young person going into science?,1
terrific time in science medicine so I,1
recommend it to anyone really as I said,1
just now the accent is on find your own,1
question you must do that you have to,1
acquire the technical knowledge but the,1
application is yours you own your,1
destiny do your own thing,1
confidently they're often rather,1
unreasonable people you know that you,1
know that reasonable people don't,1
discover the North Pole they don't,1
discover the South Pole they don't cross,1
deserts climb mountains and they don't,1
discover well to a first approximation,1
they don't discover things in science,1
but most of those scientists are in in,1
some way unreasonable people who don't,1
fit the mold and I guess for the young,1
people it's important to support them in,1
their unreasonable behavior someone will,1
always say it's not worth doing it's,1
going to be done by other people that,1
can't be done all sorts of reasons for,1
not doing research there's only are the,1
unreasonable people who really take it,1
on and also since I have an experience,1
in university the management I was head,1
of department for a while heads of,1
department have to know that often the,1
most awkward people in their department,1
are the most productive I feel careful,1
How did you react to finding out you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?,1
I'm there I'm a scientist that's one,1
yeah so we would like to be sure of our,1
facts so I was listening very carefully,1
make sure it really was Thomas Feldman,1
on the telephone before I I was,1
completely convinced of course there was,1
collateral evidence coming quite quickly,1
and in the announcement over the web and,1
and in all sorts of congratulatory notes,1
my friends and others very quickly saw,1
then realized probably true I had in,1
fact got it,1
well oxygens live essentially powers the,1
Can you describe your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery?,1
fuel of metabolism which the cells need,1
to grow to make new molecules you need,1
it for the energy of movement,1
practically everything the body does,1
needs energy and that energy comes from,1
essentially the burning combustion of of,1
oxygen that level of oxygen to support,1
the energy needs but not to cause,1
trouble has to be precisely right so we,1
discovered a system akin to a thermostat,1
for temperature but for oxygen by which,1
the cell sends the level of oxygen and,1
make hundreds or thousands of responses,1
to adjust their metabolism their,1
behavior in many many ways to the level,1
of oxygen or to adjust the level of,1
oxygen to what they need both types of,1
adjustment is the practical use of our,1
What practical uses are there for your discovery?,1
research well I think the researchers,1
we've been very fortunate we didn't,1
anticipate that we would find as the,1
oxygen sensor an enzyme an enzyme is a,1
biological catalyst and these enzymes,1
are often the targets of drugs and this,1
enzyme your oxygen sensing enzyme is a,1
classical drug target and that means,1
that we can alter that thermostat for,1
oxygen with a drug mimic the body's,1
natural response say to low oxygen and,1
improve the adaptation diseases which,1
involve low oxygen and many many,1
diseases have low oxygen hypoxia we call,1
it as a component so anemia for instance,1
can be improved by drugs which mimic,1
hypoxia make the body think it's as less,1
oxygen and move up the level of red,1
blood cell production and those drugs in,1
fact are are undergoing,1
what we call late stage trials in the US,1
and Europe there are actually licensed,1
for the treatment of the anemia,1
complicating kidney disease which is due,1
to low erythropoietin levels in in in,1
Japan and and China of course with all,1
new drugs there are uncertainties and,1
we'll know over the next so many years,1
whether this is a blockbuster cure for,1
all sorts of low-oxygen diseases or,1
whether it's difficult to do that safely,1
and the indications have to be,1
restricted I think there's a good,1
Is there good balance between basic and applied research in medicine today?,1
balance you asked about basic research,1
versus applied research research has to,1
start with the basic facts actually,1
would prefer to call it passion driven,1
research I've heard a lot of terms for,1
this curiosity division driven bottom up,1
basic research I don't think they convey,1
to the average person the reasons why we,1
do this we discover things that's what,1
we like to do we get passionate about,1
doing it and this is an important,1
principle that people work in this way,1
and they find things out that knowledge,1
long as it's secure knowledge other,1
people build on in often quite,1
unexpected ways and and our work was was,1
really unexpected we started to work on,1
erythropoietin we found this general,1
system that was a surprise to our,1
surprise also it was an enzyme that that,1
could be targeted by drugs so those are,1
all examples of passion driven research,1
that turned out to have that utility,1
that song that society is rightly,1
seeking but I'm as you see I'm I'm,1
believe things to begin with that basic,1
principle get the knowledge right and,1
many people can build on it,1
"In 2000, David Boies appeared before the Supreme Court in the case of Bush v. Gore.",0
in Bush v Gore you had sort of the highest stakes that you can in a,0
politically related case that was a case in which the presidency of the United,0
States was on the line and as someone,0
who as I said earlier it would have been a American history teacher if I hadn't been a lawyer just being present at that,0
debate and that litigation that controversy was exciting but it was it,0
was particularly exciting to be part of that legal battle because it was such a,0
critical battle for the American people the our country our culture and our law,0
it was in some sense is more important than we knew at the time I think that at,0
the time I don't think most of us fully appreciated the difference to this,0
country and to the world that it made as to whether a George W Bush or Al Gore,0
was going to become president but what we did know is that it was a momentous,0
decision and it was a decision where for the first time in American history the,0
United States Supreme Court decided a presidential election there'd been one,0
election in the past where three members of the court had participated in a,0
government commission three senators three congressmen and three Supreme Court justices had assembled together to,0
decide the results of the 1876 election but never had the Supreme Court as a,0
court weighed in to decide a presidential election and particularly,0
not on a partisan basis Al Gore won the popular vote which in every other,0
democracy is the vote but of course in the United States we have what I call,0
Villa is Electoral College where each state gets a certain number of electoral votes and those go with two small,0
exceptions those go all all to one candidate so if somebody wins,0
California by 50.000 zero one percent,0
and somebody loses California by forty,0
nine point nine nine nine nine percent what happens is all of California's,0
electoral votes goes to the winner so you know winner-take-all situation you,0
can get a situation where somebody wins by the popular vote but doesn't get a majority of electoral votes in the 2000,0
election it was clear Gore won the popular vote but and the electoral votes,0
he needed for more electoral votes to be elected Florida had and I don't remember,0
the exact number but had many times more than what he needed but if he lost Florida because he lost all of Florida,0
votes Bush would be elected president so the election really came down to Florida,0
all the other states had been decided Florida was still undecided and there were only a few hundred votes that,0
separated the two candidates and what Florida law provided and had provided,0
for eighty years is that in those cases you have a manual recount of all the,0
ballots and the reason for that is that Florida has four different kinds of vote,0
counting machines they're four different machines that are used to record votes in different parts of the state in order,0
to make it all equal you've got to have a recount then it allows people to have,0
a consistent result which is what the manual recount is designed to do and we,0
had litigation in Florida as to whether or not we would get that manual recount,0
and Florida Supreme Court ultimately held yes there has to be a statewide,0
recount we're going to recount the entire state to be fair and we're going,0
to decide the winner based on the actual voter intent of the,0
particular ballots that was what Florida law had always been the bush camp,0
appealed back to the United States Supreme Court and they had two arguments one argument was a legal argument that,0
said the Florida courts can't do that because only the Florida Legislature can do that the Supreme Court rejected that,0
argument 6 2 3 they also however argued that the vote,0
count ought to be stopped because it somehow violated the Equal Protection Clause that decision was five to four,0
against us and it was a decision that the Supreme Court initially made on a,0
Saturday without ever hearing argument they heard argument two days later and,0
and came out with the same result but they initially stopped the vote County before they even had an argument over,0
the very bitter dissent of four of the justices but in our legal system when,0
this United States Supreme Court makes a decision that's the end of the road,0
there wasn't anything else you can do it was a tough time it was a frustrating time it was disappointing time and as I,0
say I think as time has gone on I think you know people have moved on from that,0
and I think that's the right thing to do but I think we will always wonder how,0
the world would have been different how our country would have been different,0
how the economy would have been different how international relations would have been different the lives that,0
might have been saved the treasurer that might have been saved if Supreme Court,0
had ruled 5-4 in favor of Gore as opposed to 5-4 in favor of Bush it was,0
clearly a very important case it was clear that it was a very very important case important to who became president,0
but also important to the integrity of our law and the way we resolve disputes,0
now I think that I think that the case,0
fortunately is not going to be a precedent for future elections I think I,0
think I think everybody is sort of learned in retrospect the lesson that the supreme court ought not to be play,0
that kind of role and indeed even in the Supreme Court decision itself it says in,0
effect this isn't a precedent for the future so I think that the long-term,0
damage that the case does to our law is not going to be is not going to be significant four of the justices wrote,0
very very strong dissents they're a passionate dissents and and obviously,0
the sense that I agreed with on the other hand again one of the things that,0
I think is is critically important is our belief in and our allegiance to the,0
rule of law and when the Supreme Court makes a decision I think we we accept it,0
and move on,0
Perry v. Hollingsworth...,0
Nate California passed so-called Proposition 8 that banned marriage,0
between anybody of the same sex this declared that marriage was limited,0
to a man and a woman and that was contrary to what California law had been,0
immediately preceding that because the California Supreme Court earlier in 2008,0
had declared that under the state constitution any loving couple had a,0
right to get married now when that was changed that deprived,0
gay and lesbian citizens the right to get married and Ted Olson and I brought,0
a lawsuit to challenge proposition 8 under the Federal Constitution and,0
ultimately the judge ruled that the ban,0
on same-sex marriage violated the Federal Constitution violated equal protection and due process clauses the,0
Federal Constitution and invalidated proposition 8 in that decision was,0
ultimately sustained by the court of appeals and the Supreme Court on the,0
grounds that the people on the other side the defendants really didn't have standing to oppose judgment,0
What cases are you proudest of?,0
I think that you know cases are in some,0
senses a little like children I have six children and hard to say which one I'm most proud of but but I think that,0
certainly the marriage equality cases are cases that I am enormous ly proud of,0
I think that we have in in those cases,0
contributed to a really important change in this country the cases that I've done,0
in the area of racial equality as a young lawyer working in Mississippi and,0
then later on I successfully sued the Republican National Committee on behalf,0
of a Democratic National Committee in 1986 I think it was to stop the RNC from,0
targeting black and minority districts with voter ID voter security kinds of,0
tactics I mean that litigation I'm very,0
proud I'm proud of the Microsoft case that was a important challenging case,0
I'm certainly proud of Westmorland CBS liable case I think that was very,0
important in terms of establishing and confirming freedom of the press and the,0
ability of the press to engage in very direct hostile criticism of government,0
government action being from speech freedom of the press I'm proud of the,0
the Bush v Gore even though we lost I think that the example that we gave to,0
the country was an important example I think I think the record that we made,0
was important in convincing the people,0
and convincing the court not to repeat it even though we didn't win that case I,0
think the controversy that ensued in part because of the record we made I think has been helpful in,0
limiting the extent to which that kind of interference with a democratic,0
political process will be repeated I also think that the way that case was,0
conducted and with Ted Olson and what what Ted and his team did together with,0
what we did you know showed the American people that even the most contentious,0
issues can be resolved in the courts and,0
well I might disagree with how it was resolved I think everybody on both sides,0
of the lawyers there believed that it was resolved in a way that gave the,0
legal process credibility and everybody everybody involved in the case,0
you know acted with professionalism integrity and and after the fact,0
everybody United together to say this is the final decision we've all got to,0
abide by it and move on I'm also proud of a couple of antitrust cases that,0
don't necessarily get the same profile but are often very important I defended,0
IBM in a case in the 1970s that was brought against it by private parties,0
that we're trying to prevent IBM from competing by price on price and we,0
established a principle that even somebody would not be power can compete,0
on price as long as it's not totally blow cost and that case incidentally,0
when I argued that case in the court of appeals I argued it in front of a panel that included Anthony Kennedy that is,0
this was before he was on the Supreme Court so my first case in front of Justice,0
Kennedy was oh this is almost must be 35 years ago 35 more years ago and there,0
was a another antitrust case where I represented skaar where they were accused of,0
violating the antitrust laws and they were trying to get private parties are,0
trying to get court to intervene and regulate how they conducted their business and we won that case and that,0
was important to to establishing the right of companies to manage manage,0
their own affairs and to compete vigorously I mean the antitrust laws are not designed to protect competitors from,0
competition they're designed to make sure that competition is not snuffed out,0
United States v. Microsoft...,0
in Microsoft you had what was at the time and the most successful and the,0
most valuable company in the world it was a company that as a company was,0
widely admired it had was led by an individual Bill Gates who was widely,0
admired I they had changed the personal,0
computing way in fundamentally and in a,0
way that we're never going back to the world was different and better because,0
what Microsoft had done and yet there,0
were very serious and I trust issues involved and so what you had to do was,0
you had to in a sense challenge this iconic man in this iconic company and do,0
it in a way that you could get a court to decide that it would intervene in the,0
marketplace and influence the decisions that this company was making and the,0
company's defense was what we're doing is best for the consumer that's always been our goal we've served the consumer,0
very well and you courts are going to come in and screw it all up and that was,0
a powerful argument and to the extent that the court trusted Microsoft that,0
was a winning argument which we had to do is we had to convince the court that,0
the court could not trust Microsoft to simply decide what was best for consumers the first thing that we did,0
was we needed to show the judge that there was a genuine dispute and the case,0
really involved I think the the central part of the case was a company called,0
Netscape had come out with a browser and everybody has browsers now but web,0
browsers at the time were very new and Netscape really had come out with a browser that dominated the market and,0
Microsoft was afraid that if the netscape browser really took hold people,0
would write programs for the netscape browser as opposed to the microsoft operating system that would eliminate,0
the tremendous advantage that microsoft had because everybody wanted a program to windows and it was critical to him,0
protecting microsoft's windows monopoly and that the browser from another,0
company like netscape not become too popular and so what they did was they,0
tied microsoft browser to the operating system in a way that made it difficult,0
for netscape to compete it and the question was did they have to do that,0
because if they had to tie it for the consumers sake then that Skate probably,0
couldn't complain but if they did it just to stymie netscape then there could,0
be an antitrust violation and of course they came in and said what we just did it because this was a better way to,0
serve the consumer and the first thing we had to do is we had to convince the,0
court that there was a reasonable argument on both sides here so that they,0
knew that the court knew that there was a necessity of trusting Microsoft and,0
then we had to show the court that Microsoft was not trustworthy and we did,0
that by attacking and undercutting and,0
showing that what they said that their narrative was simply not true ultimately we won the case the the,0
district court granted very very broad relief relief was cut back by the court,0
of appeals but the finding of liability was sustained unanimously by the Court,0
of Appeals and one things the Court of Appeals said was that they that the,0
arguments that Microsoft had made to justify the tie-in of the browser to the,0
operating system were simply pretextual and and they would not have been they,0
would not have been prepared I think to reach that conclusion if Microsoft,0
technical witnesses had maintained their credibility better we had a situation in,0
which for example one of their witnesses sponsored a tape that purported to show,0
a microsoft operating system being used,0
on the computer with a microsoft browser and then taking the microsoft browser off putting on the netscape browser and,0
it showed a deterioration of the performance and the way it was presented,0
was that computer was just running one computer and all that changed was the,0
change of the browser and as such that was a very powerful video and it was a,0
video that we had enormous difficulty figuring out how to attack because we,0
couldn't figure out why that performance was degraded and we couldn't replicate,0
that by the other hand we couldn't figure out how to attack what they had shown ultimately we were able to,0
demonstrate that what they had done was they had spliced together footage from,0
two different computers with two different programs and that it really,0
was a fabricated document and ultimately,0
Microsoft admitted that what they said was that they had accomplished this,0
result in the laboratory but then when they tried to film it they couldn't,0
repeat it and so what they did they made up this tape and introduced in,0
evidence now if they'd said all that at the time the tape never would have gotten into evidence but not saying it,0
was clearly misleading and badly and this was just one of several examples badly undercut their their credibility,0
and there's always a danger here that the drama will overwhelm facts and,0
that a dramatic instance of that kind of cross-examination will be given too much,0
weight but in fact in a case like this where the real issue is can you trust,0
this company to be doing what it says that is serving the consumers as opposed,0
to locking out competitors I think there's a good argument that a very,0
heavy weight on such kind of dissembling is appropriate I think that there's,0
always a danger that when you have this kind of decision that government will,0
overreact and I think in the United States we avoided that but in in Europe,0
I think that one of the unintended,0
consequences of of a Microsoft case was I think that the finding of liability,0
and to some extent the damage that occurred to Microsoft's credibility led,0
the European regulators to impose regulations on them that were actually,0
quite anti-competitive and anti-consumer so I think that one of the things you,0
always have to be alert to in these kind of situations particularly where the government is involved is that you want,0
to be sure that the remedy matches the violation the original remedy by the,0
district court which while very broad was a divestiture remedy they required,0
the separation of the operating system from application programming and that while,0
quite drastic would not have inhibited competition in the way that some of,0
European regulatory acts did so I think,0
that Microsoft was a very important case and he was very important in terms of,0
antitrust enforcement policy here in the United States but it was not it was not,0
a case that did not have some consequences that I think we're not who,0
are not ideal,0
"When you lose, do you wonder what you could have done differently?",0
it's always hard to know whether you could have done anything differently I,0
mean obviously Bush v Gore did not go the way I would have liked to have it go but looking back I can't see of how we,0
could have change people's minds I mean particularly since they stopped the vote,0
County before we had the argument by the same vote count that they ultimately decided the five to four that they,0
decided the ultimate decision so I don't see anything there although I've thought,0
about it probably a lot other cases I,0
mean there was a case that I worked on,0
in the 1970s rising out of Jackson State,0
College shootings and turmoil that followed Martin Luther King's,0
assassination where we represented the students that had been injured and the,0
families of the students that had been killed in the Jackson City College shootings and we established that the,0
police had used excessive force too hard when you shoot up a college dormitory,0
but we established that they had used excessive force in the shootings but,0
because a lot of what was used with shotguns we could not trace the bullet,0
or pellet that injured or killed a particular student to a particular gun so we couldn't prove which of the,0
officers had been responsible for which injury now we were able to prove which,0
officers used excessive force but linking that causally to it now we,0
thought that that didn't matter because they were all engaged in a common activity and when that is true you're,0
responsible for what everybody is doing but the courts ruled against us it there,0
and and there was never a recovery for those shootings and I have and we that,0
was a case that we tried to take the Supreme Court and we got three votes for cert but you need four so we missed it,0
again missed it by one the Supreme Court justice and I've I've not figured out,0
how we could have presented it differently but that's the kind of thing that you think about,0
Westmoreland v. CBS...,0
in the Westmoreland case what had happened is CBS had broadcast a documentary that was very critical of,0
general Westmoreland's handling of the Vietnam War and general Westmoreland had sued for like 120 million dollars,0
damages which was in the 1980s even more money than it is now and what was at,0
stake was the ability of the press to criticize government officials in the,0
conduct of their official activities and this was not a situation in which CBS,0
was printing something about the generals personal life or accusing him of shoplifting or anything that might be,0
unrelated to his office his official duties this is this was a broadcast,0
criticizing the commanding general in one of America's most unpopular Wars for,0
the conduct of that war and we thought that it would send a terrible message to,0
say that that commander could then block,0
that criticism and recover damages for it in other words what the documentary,0
essentially asserted was that in order to keep support for the war and at home,0
in the United States they had given a falsely optimistic picture of how well,0
the war was going and they had done so in part by manipulating enemy troop,0
strength statistics to show that they were killing and eliminating more of the,0
enemy than they actually were and so they kept telling the American people that they were winning the war and they,0
were using these statistics to prove it but the statistics were not true in,0
addition to general Westmoreland there were a number of very high-ranking public officials who both were,0
represented in the broadcast and who appeared at trial and this was it this was a case in which,0
most of the evidence came from witnesses who were not on CB s aside most of the,0
evidence came from military personnel government officials former government,0
officials so we had to make our case largely through cross-examination and,0
one of the things that we had to do was to demonstrate that Westmoreland's,0
narrative was not true and that Aris was and again credibility became critically,0
important and it was a difficult cross-examination of Westmoreland,0
because Westmoreland was somebody who had devoted his entire life to serving,0
his country you might agree or disagree with what he did and what he said but he,0
was obviously a patriot who had done whatever he did because he believed that was in the country's interest and so you,0
had to be very careful not to offend the jury by attacking him too early and,0
here's I mentioned patience before patience was absolutely critical to that,0
cross-examination because I had to get the jury to understand that he wasn't,0
being forthcoming before I challenged him before I asserted that because if I,0
had simply gone in on a frontal attack right from the beginning I could have,0
turned that jury off of when I first caught him in inconsistencies rather,0
than build it up like I said I would ordinarily do I actually would under play it I would say Oh general exponent,0
you said this now that just seems to me a little inconsistent with this document I'm sure there's an explanation,0
can you tell tell me what the explanation is and so I would go through that until and I did that for an entire,0
day before I really began to pick up the pace because I wanted the jury to become,0
uncomfortable you could just tell from the way the jurors would look and they'd shift that his explanations just didn't,0
hold water and they understood that and so once they begin to understand that he,0
was not being completely accurate in his in his testimony you could begin to push,0
him a little harder and one of the critical points in the examination was and this happened after,0
I built up I think some credibility with the jury and I had undermined the,0
generals credibility I asked I asked him whether he had not consciously attempted,0
to convey an optimistic picture and he said he had not and I said well general,0
you certainly went around telling people that there was light at the end of the tunnel didn't you do that and he said,0
absolutely not I wouldn't I wouldn't do that because I it wasn't true and that's too optimistic and I would never have,0
said that and so I now I did build it up because I had a cable from him to,0
Maxwell Taylor saying I can now tell you that there's light at the end of the tunnel and so once that came out and it,0
was it was even more important than it had to be because if if he had simply,0
said yes I was optimistic I believed we were winning or if he had simply said yes I said there was light at the end of,0
tunnel because I thought there was but when he said I would never say that it's not true and then you confronted that,0
was really devastating consequence and and and he ultimately just dropped his,0
lawsuit without any payment or any compensation,0
Courtroom strategy...,0
gambling and litigation like flying an,0
airplane or sailing a sailboat in the open ocean is not intrinsically,0
difficult but it is terribly unforgiving of even small mistakes,0
small mistakes may have disproportionately large adverse,0
consequences and so you have to be patient you have to be careful and you,0
have to be sure that you understand what the risks are it's very easy in times of,0
stress tension or excitement to be less careful to be less patient to be more,0
emotional that can have devastating consequences for a gambler or a lawyer,0
or a pilot or a sailor control the facts control the narrative you've got,0
competing narratives and that is if you've got a good opponent you've got competing narratives I and you want the,0
jury to focus on your narrative and you never want to let the other side control,0
your story and control your narrative now that's not always easy to do because,0
trials are you put a witness on and you examine them and they examine them and,0
they always get a chance to ask questions and they always get a chance to put on their own witnesses so you,0
can't control the flow of information that comes in so what you have to do is,0
you have to look well you can is package mold present that information in a way,0
that supports the narrative that you're you're presenting and and to do that,0
probably the single most important thing is to be sure that you understand the,0
narrative and that that narrative is true now everybody is going to pick a,0
true narrative that supports their case that's what advocates do but you must be,0
sure that the narrative is true there are truths that will support your case,0
and there usually some truths that will support the other person's case the danger is that you aren't willing,0
ready to rely just on the truth that,0
supports your case and what you try to do to try to support your case with other things that aren't going to be,0
able to sustain the weight of cross-examination the weight of a contrary narrative the weight of,0
cross-examination from the other side the weight of contrary documents because,0
in that case if you try to build your narrative on things that you cannot,0
demonstrably prove you risk losing the credibility of the jury and you risk,0
confusing the jury because now they think that some of the things you put in there that you couldn't sustain our,0
things that are really important to you whereas what you want to be doing is trying to convince the jury that the,0
only thing that is important are the truth that supports your case most cases,0
not every case but most cases have,0
points truths that support that case,0
certainly the cases that I do generally don't get to court unless there is,0
something to be said for both sides now the Perry case the marriage equality,0
case was an exception to that rule the other side just didn't have a case yeah,0
they didn't have any truths,0
When were you first attracted to the law?,0
I think in grade school when I was reading Perry Mason novels I think from,0
as early as I can remember I wanted either to be a high school history teacher American history teacher like my,0
father was or a lawyer like Perry Mason it was criminal basically criminal,0
defense but it was it was trial work it was the conducting of a trial the,0
investigatory phase the analytical phase it was very exciting challenging and it,0
was the kind of thing that I knew I'd be interested in I think it was just a,0
combination of competitiveness analytical ability I've never been great,0
at reading so something where you could use your mind and you could analyze,0
problems and you could present problems orally with something that was,0
attractive to me but it was it was the excitement it was the challenge a trial,0
is essentially a morality play you're you're trying you've got to have a,0
narrative you've got to have a story you've got to be trying to explain to the judge or the jury why your client is,0
right and the other side is wrong but you've got to do it in the context of making them understand how that fits in,0
to a narrative that they can believe to be credible I have written a couple of books but for me the sort of highest and,0
best use was in in the courtroom or teaching I still do love to teach and I,0
teach occasionally as an adjunct professor but I would have I would have,0
been very happy I think as a American history teacher and I'm drew Happy's,0
lawyer,0
What did you admire about your father's work as a history teacher?,0
I think it was a combination of things it was his ability to relate to students,0
it was his mastery of the subject matter and the interest of the subject matter,0
you couldn't not be interested in American history,0
growing up with him but I think I would have been interested in American history in any event because I believe it is so,0
important to our culture and so important to the kind of people we are the kind of values we have the kind of,0
problems we face and the way we we need to reach solutions to those problems history teaches us so much about that,0
and about the nature of the American experience the nature of the American culture the nature of the American,0
people we are a unusual society unusual,0
nation we don't have a traditional historical ancestral land we aren't of a,0
single race when out of a single religion there is no sort of ethnic,0
definition of an American we don't even have a common language what binds us,0
together as a people is our culture and history is really the keeper of that,0
culture the first things you have to do when you take on a case is what every,0
writer every investigative reporter every playwright has to do and that is,0
understand what the facts are understand what the story is that is available,0
there what is the raw material you have to work with who are the characters that,0
you have what are the events what are the historical markers that you've got to deal with what are the documents that,0
you have to deal with and then you try to figure out what are the truths and,0
supports your client how do you construct a narrative that relies on the,0
truths that are helpful to a narrative that will lead the judge of the jury,0
for your client and that requires all of,0
the analytical and presentational skills of somebody who's going to put on a play,0
or a movie documentary because what you're trying to do is you're trying to,0
present a narrative that the jury can understand absorb and be motivated by,0
now the complicating factor is that unlike a play you can't write the script,0
for all the players you can only write the script and write the script is a,0
even for your own witnesses it's not perfect ability but you can only determine what,0
witnesses you call for your side the other side gets a chance to bring in,0
their witnesses and they get dance or ask your witnesses questions so you've,0
got to present your story at least in part by asking questions of people who,0
don't want to give you answers that will help your narrative and you have to use,0
your ability to ask questions of people who do want to help you to be sure you focus what they say in a way that's,0
going to provide truthful but supportive answers it's easy to get truthful,0
answers if you don't have to worry about them support in your case and you can sometimes get supportive answers if you,0
don't have to worry about the truth but to get truthful supportive answers it's,0
what you've got to do and and to do that you've got to understand the facts better than anybody else even better,0
than the parties when you try case,0
involving a company whether it's your client or somebody else's client you've,0
got to understand their business their products their issues than they do themselves John is a very,0
important aspect and it's important in in a couple of respect I mean first of all it's important just so that the jury,0
doesn't get so bored that they don't listen remember they they don't have to listen,0
and if you don't keep with them at least interested enough so that they're gonna,0
pay attention it doesn't make any difference how good your case is because they won't hear it they won't absorb it so you've got to,0
find a way of keeping their interest and remember you're trying in some cases to,0
keep their interest for weeks or months about a subject that's very complicated that they don't know anything about it's,0
hard and so unless you have some drama involved in that you're gonna lose their,0
interest the second thing that you wanted you want to use drama for is to emphasize the points that you make those,0
can be points of substance or they can,0
be points of undercutting the credibility of the other side but you want to have enough drama there so that,0
you are emphasizing the things that help you and for example sometimes a lawyer,0
will find that a witness has said something that for the other side has said something that's not accurate and,0
the instinct is to show them a document or something and it shows that it's not,0
accurate and just do that immediately now if you do that that's helpful but if you save them now you just said,0
this you don't really mean that do you they say oh yes I absolutely mean it,0
you're just making that up aren't you you're just making that up um now this,0
is a dramatic confrontation now the jury is focusing on it now if you've made it,0
dramatic you damn well better be sure that you've got nailed that you're going,0
to be able to show to the jury that the person did just make it up because if you confront them,0
dramatically and then you can't follow through not only have you not made your point but you've damaged your credibility but,0
if you've really got it nailed what you want to do is you want to build up that conflict build it up before you demolish,0
it so that when you demolish it it's a dramatic event that the jury is really,0
really focused on,0
Dyslexia...,0
I had a tough time reading in elementary school elementary school was not intrinsically difficult for me but I,0
didn't read until I was in third grade at all and when I did start to read I,0
read slowly and I'm still not a fast reader it was diagnosed I must have been,0
this would have been in 1974 so I was in my middle 30s what happened was one of,0
my middle children had substantial difficulties reading in kindergarten,0
early first-grade and so we took him to be tested and analyzed and they determined he had dyslexia and the,0
person who was doing it wanted to examine the parents and it became clear,0
that I was the culprit but I had never I never even heard the word dyslexia and,0
and didn't really focus on the fact that I had a learning disability at all when,0
I grew up I grew up in a small farming community in Illinois in the 1940s in,0
that time and in that place how well little boy read it was not a particularly important factor and,0
certainly was not a defining quality in terms of how either I thought of myself,0
or other people thought of me I was good at other aspects of school and the fact that I read slowly didn't seem to bother,0
most people and didn't bother me at the time that's quite different for the way children are faced today today reading,0
and academic competition becomes terribly important even in early grades and tends to find the way children look,0
at themselves their peers look at them and even their parents look at them and that's it that's a terribly,0
disadvantageous thing I didn't read very well but I was really good at arithmetic and I was really good at social studies,0
and even my reading was masked my,0
reading problems were masked a little bit by the fact that I could memorize,0
On the high school debate team...,0
in debate you tend to prepare these note cards and he write down all these things,0
in the note cards and and then during a debate you'll reference the note cards and one of the things I found it was,0
because of my dyslexia it was really not practical for me to use note cards it,0
took me too long to sort of find my place in the note card read the point,0
and then come back and as you know from interviewing people if you've got a,0
camera or a tape recorder running three or four or five seconds of dead time,0
seems like an eternity and so if you're in a debate and you sort of lose your,0
place it takes you three or four or five or six seconds you've sort of lost your audience so I had to learn to speak,0
extemporaneously I've had to learn to have an outline in my head and then,0
speak around that outline without having taught being tied to notes or scripts,0
and as I learned that which was really essential for me given my dyslexia and,0
that turned out to be a very helpful and powerful skill later you want to give,0
your opponent chance to make a mistake you want to be sure that before if you've got a trap before you spring the,0
trap everything is in place you want to be sure that your case is well-prepared,0
that you haven't gone too far out on a limb you've not exposed your credibility most,0
important thing in a trial is your credibility because particularly with a,0
jury high you've got 12 citizens who have been brought in they don't know anything,0
about you they don't know I think about your opponent they don't know anything about the case in fact if they know,0
anything about you or your opponent or the case they probably can't serve on the jury so you've got a blank slate,0
that you're working with now how are they going to figure out who to trust how they gonna figure out who to believe,0
they're gonna believe the person that has credibility and that credibility is built up over time and so if you lose,0
credibility with respect to a point you're not only losing that point but you may be losing your ability,0
to keep for the juries trust and if you've lost that you've lost the case and you you want to be sure and that as,0
you develop your narrative I need to develop your case you are developing,0
something at the beginning that you'll be able to sustain at the end too often,0
people have the most colorful and often very quite persuasive arguments at the,0
beginning that they're not going to be able to sustain at the end and that's worse than not having them at all,0
because what you've done is not only if you lost it but you have told the jury that you've lost it and you've probably,0
lost your credibility along the way,0
The American Dream...,0
the American dream a dream of equality opportunity of constant progress of,0
openness inclusiveness I think is what is a core part of what we think of as,0
the American culture I think that the American dream of that kind of,0
opportunity inequality is what allows us I think to be innovative to be,0
entrepreneurial to be creative to take chances and it is what allows us to not,0
only tolerate but celebrate individual achievement I one of the things that I,0
regret in the last few decades is the sense of we them us they 1% 99 percent,0
the haves have not kind of conflict where people who have too much or trying,0
to hold on to it people who don't have enough or trying to take it from somebody else what we as a people have always thought,0
is that we work together to try to expand the pie and to try to give every new generation an opportunity the,0
problem comes when people believe that the new generation is not going to have,0
an equal opportunity part of the social compact I think that binds us together,0
as a people is the sense that we will tolerate and as I say even celebrate,0
somebody else's success because we believe our children will have the same opportunity to achieve that success when,0
that is no longer true when we no longer think our children are going to get a,0
new deal then our willingness to tolerate those kind of differences,0
diminishes and I think that it's important that we try to get back to the,0
principle of equality of opportunity it's not equality of result but it's,0
quality of opportunity but if an equal result in one generation is going to,0
destroy the quality of opportunity of the next generation people are not going to tolerate that,0
welcome everybody to interview and to cinema time magazine,0
described this amazing woman as one of the nation's most effective,0
advocate of family rights and feminist causes,0
president barack obama referred to her as one of the best attorneys in the,0
country she's a partner at the los angeles law firm of allred morocco and goldberg,0
her law firm has been the leading women's rights law firm in the united,0
states for 44 years and have won hundreds of millions of dollars,0
for victims she has been inducted into the national women's hall of fame,0
and has received the lifetime achievement award from the national trial lawyers on,0
january 2021 she will also receive,0
a lifetime achievement award from the american lawyer magazine i can't tell you,0
how delighted and excited i am and honored to introduce today's interview guest,0
the great gloria allred gloria i'm so happy to see you she's,0
also my friend but my friend by the way everybody so i want you to know that i know this,0
woman as an incredibly kind loving genuine friend that would,0
always have your back so that's from my personal side but we have so much,0
you know to talk about gloria in 1984 you represented rita mia and she,0
she was actually raped by seven catholic priests and you took on the catholic priests,0
in the entire case and that's really taking on a huge power what was it like,0
for you and her to go through it and make it public and really confront,0
something that ached from so much of america well first of all thank you very,0
much daphne for inviting me to join you today on this interview on,0
cinema you are a very warm dear person and,0
a very talented person and a very charitable person and i admire,0
you and i'm honored to be with you for this interview in reference to my client,0
rita mia uh she was and is a very courageous person and,0
uh rita came to me she alleged that she had been sexually abused by seven catholic,0
priests and had a baby by one of them and of course you know there were other,0
attorneys who felt that they couldn't take on the catholic church that they were too,0
powerful and uh then it was suggested to her that,0
she come to me uh and of course i'm not concerned about the powerful we,0
are used to waging what we call david versus goliath battles davita versus goliath battles,0
and uh i felt that there certainly was evidence that what she was saying was,0
true and that injustice had been done to her and that i had to uh take on her case,0
to support her uh to guide her to help her to win as much justice as was possible,0
under the circumstances that may have been one of the first,0
cases against the catholic church that was made public and it was covered all over the world,0
and uh later we found out that there was even discussion of this case in the vatican and,0
uh that was in the vatican files uh having said that uh we,0
were on a long legal journey together and of course when we filed the lawsuit,0
against the seven catholic priests uh many of them suddenly disappeared,0
from the parishes that they were in and went apparently elsewhere so that they couldn't be,0
located i will say that after 23 years of litigation agitation,0
and uh legislation uh we ultimately were able to settle,0
with the catholic church i i think they couldn't take it anymore it was like peeling back layers of the,0
onion and more and more people came out about pre-sexual abuse and uh,0
and on and on so uh we fought that battle uh from our point of view we won that,0
battle uh many many people found that to be a,0
teaching moment that you know to stand up against sexual,0
abuse whether it's against a powerful institution such as the church uh,0
and we did find out that there was a cover-up uh in part that uh we gained uh,0
uh possession of a letter uh in which the uh bishop was uh or the archbishop,0
was indicating to one of the priests that he should not come back to the united states,0
uh that he even told to leave the united states he should not come back because of a lawsuit that was pending and that was of course,0
our lawsuit uh but we found that you know if we can,0
persist we can resist uh we can succeed and we ultimately did win,0
a settlement for her and uh i ended up uh some years later also uh representing,0
her uh baby who grew up and we did ultimately prove that one of the uh priests was in fact,0
the father of her child uh he had been required to take a dna test,0
by the court and it showed that in fact he was the father of the child i always say the child was indeed,0
a child of the church uh that her father was a father father,0
because she was conceived in the church's rectory so all i can say is uh rita,0
in many ways started a movement a movement for change a movement for justice and i was very,0
very honored to be part of that journey to justice yeah you know the amazing part is the,0
impact on her and also on the community because um you,0
know that kind of thing went on as we know in many other areas of the catholic church,0
and i believe that they this had such an impact on so many people that were silent but how,0
did it impact her and her child well uh you know one day i'm sure,0
they're going to speak for themselves but and i would like them to be able to do that but all i can say,0
is rita is one of the bravest people i've ever met because you can imagine,0
that it was hard in the 1980s for many people to even imagine that priests could do,0
such a thing and uh and that and that the church might be involved,0
in you know in a sense in covering it up but now we know that's all possible and,0
now uh you know they have had to be accountable to so many people to so many,0
children for example who were sexually abused and they've had to be accountable to the,0
parents of those children rita of course was a uh devout catholic,0
at the time she wanted to be a nun in fact uh and her parents sent her to the church because they wanted her to be,0
safe and they felt that would be a safe place for her so what i can say,0
is uh rita is is just soldiering on through her life uh and she continues to be an,0
inspiration to me and to many others who have stood up and decided that they,0
too are going to seek justice yeah and which you know really leads me to,0
another case and again you seem to peek on the underdog and you see well,0
actually they you know all my clients they choose me no they come to me i don't look for them,0
and i know that's not what you meant but just to be clear that uh you know they,0
come to me uh and and i of course can't take every case but i,0
do think very carefully about each one see if if this is the case that i should take,0
um and so yes i do represent the person who generally has had no powers had no voice has had,0
no justice and i do that and i represent them against the powerful and this is what i work to work to,0
equalize the playing field so that power can meet power on an equal playing field well one one case that has,0
changed the world for women obviously was rob versus wade,0
and you represented norma mccovey who was the original jane doe,0
and you know exposing her in a very risky time you know exposing who she was and all,0
the animosity at the time was really dangerous and yet you really,0
stuck by her and really created a platform and of course rob versus where it is,0
something that all of us every woman i believe that understands the reality of their,0
lives and what are the consequences that is one of the fundamental rights,0
that women have to fight for so tell me about that environment you were very,0
you know astonishing in in even early on at that time,0
in terms of giving voice to that tell me how that changed your life why were you so vocal about it,0
and what in your life created the pathway for you to make this,0
choice to be a leader in that arena for all women well roe v wade was one of the most,0
important united states supreme court decisions ever it it decided that women do,0
have a legal right to choose safe legal affordable available abortions,0
and that's important because prior to 1973 when roe v wade was decided in many,0
states in the united states states had made it a crime to have an,0
abortion not necessarily for a pregnant woman to have one but for a licensed health care provider such,0
as a doctor to provide it and therefore women had to go to if they wanted an abortion uh,0
generally to uh back alley abortionist who was not licensed who only did it for,0
the money and many women prior to 1973 in the united states,0
then uh were maimed or died from illegal abortions i,0
was a person who was a victim of gender violence uh in mexico many years ago and,0
when i came back to the united states and found that i was pregnant i wanted to have an abortion and then i,0
found out that it was a crime in many states or that at least at the minimum i would have to go through so,0
many hoops to get one that you know it just might be too late by the time i,0
i was able to get one or i didn't want to go through all that uh because i didn't want to be public,0
about it uh in any event so i had to have a back alley abortionist i,0
ended up uh hemorrhaging with uh a 106 fever i think i had and i had to,0
be taken to the hospital and packed in ice and almost died so and and that by the way i i discuss,0
in my documentary on netflix which is still streaming called seeing,0
all red so big and and then of course and the nurse in the hospital said to me,0
well i hope this teaches you a lesson um of course it did teach me a lesson,0
but the lesson was not the one that she thought i should learn it was that i believe that abortion must be,0
legal so that women don't have to risk their lives uh by having illegal abortions that is,0
abortions which could lead to their death so i have been for all of my,0
adult life a major uh supporter of legal abortions and of course,0
since 1973 the roe v wade decision it's you know that having abortion,0
be legal has been at risk because the anti-choice people whom i,0
also call the mandatory motherhood crowd they you know they,0
have been doing everything they could to chip away to erode to eliminate that constitutional right,0
to choose abortion in other words it didn't end in 1973 with roe v wade um and so ultimately while,0
well i was not the person who argued before the united states supreme court in roe v wade i did meet,0
uh jane rowe the real jane rowe and um at actually it was the pro-choice,0
rally and she came up and introduced herself to me and i was,0
asking her well are you going to be speaking and i was really shocked to learn that she had not been invited to speak,0
and yet the whole rally was about roe v wade in any event uh we we got to know each other and she,0
wanted to speak out and so i assisted her in doing that because i wanted people to know there's a real person,0
here not just an anonymous name jane,0
doe and she was very happy and wanted her actual name to be out,0
there so i helped her to speak out over the years there was a point,0
a little bit later in her life uh where she decided to then go over to the anti-choice side and,0
uh of course since i'm all about choice i have to support her choice not to be,0
pro-choice why i decide to choose why did she decide that,0
well she didn't say at the time but right before her death she did an interview and she seems to,0
have indicated in that interview which i've seen that really,0
because she was getting paid to be anti-choice uh you know and that she was in dire,0
economic circumstances and she needed the money so the pro-choice side was not providing,0
economic uh support for her but the anti-choice people were willing to do that but,0
she revealed she was actually a pro-choice person so in any event it's not my job to judge,0
women and second-guess them and criticize them it's my job to you know try to,0
understand them and help them through difficult circumstances if i can if i'm the person to do that so uh i was,0
very happy at that at the end she in a way fessed up as they say,0
uh confessed that she really was pro-choice so that means that she's really not somebody that the,0
anti-choice uh movement can use any longer but i i have been very concerned about,0
issues of reproductive rights years ago i sued a right to life pregnancy,0
counseling center for false advertising and uh we were successful with that case,0
so we will continue to to be ever vigilant that roe v wade still you know,0
is maintained bestows the law of the land and that we can not allow it ever to,0
states ever to criminalize abortion again and right now you know we're particularly vulnerable,0
because of the supreme court's makeup and because the last administration,0
chose so many concerned conservative judges justices so how do you think,0
that is going to fan out in terms of roe versus wayne well daphne you just,0
made a very very important point and that is the selection of the justices to the united,0
states supreme court that trump uh actually rushed through,0
uh the confirmation of now associate justice of the u.s supreme,0
court amy coney barrett she obviously was chosen in part,0
because she has been extremely anti-choice and that is not an opinion that's just a,0
fact uh because there was evidence that she'd signed petitions uh you know against abortion and had,0
you know she has very very strict views about uh abortion what she will do in,0
future roe v wade cases or what i call the offspring of roe v wade you know it it does send,0
chills down my arm and at worry is of concern to me because we know,0
where she stands and the balance of the supreme court now has been tilted to the extreme right,0
um and um so the loss of my shiro and i'm sure,0
you're shiro and then i'll put that right here and that's ruth bader ginsburg,0
the loss of her on the united states supreme court and the filling of her,0
seat with amy coney barrett who has in many ways diametrically opposed views to,0
uh ruth bader ginsburg is something that is going to lead for serious consequences and i believe a cut,0
back on women's rights in the years to come and she's a young woman,0
so she might serve for 40 50 years on the united states supreme court,0
we always say elections have consequences and one of the consequences of trump's,0
election or selection depending on your point of view was that he was able to appoint believe,0
three justices to the u.s supreme court and they were uh jammed through,0
uh by mitch mcconnell because this republicans also control the united,0
states senate that is there in the majority and all persons who wish to be confirmed as,0
justices of the supreme court have to be confirmed by the senate judiciary committee and so of course the majority were,0
republicans and they just voted for you know whomever senator mcconnell,0
uh wanted to be confirmed there might have been a one or two here,0
and there who who refused to go along with it but obviously there were enough republicans to make sure that,0
all those three choices those nominations of uh trump were confirmed so we'll have,0
to see what happens in future years um i i'm not optimistic about,0
you know about civil rights uh in the era of the supreme court in the near future,0
so um this is what concerns me a tremendous amount because right now,0
you mentioned that there is a war against women um i launched this network and,0
it's amazingly enough we actually have as many male viewers as women viewers which is,0
great but i launched it to address the interest and the needs of women,0
and to platform women in a in a better way than the last so many decades,0
have been doing but i'd like to commend you on that if i may interrupt because my understanding daphne is that you are,0
the only woman who owns a television network,0
is that true yes it is oprah was the other one but unfortunately,0
in order to protect the content she had to sell a lot of her shares,0
to be able to produce more content that elevated her brand so she actually has suffered,0
losing a tremendous amount of her shares i just want to commend you because you're a pioneer and a travel,0
blazer and it's not easy it's complicated and i'm sure you have to fight every day,0
uh to uh you know to support and protect what you have built,0
so i want people to know you know the first one is the one who breaks through the glass,0
ceiling and then i know daphne you're a very big advocate for,0
you know equal rights for women and then helps others to be able to move forward,0
well you know a part of it is we have actually premiered a great film called woman i'm sure,0
you've seen it and it took five years to interview women who broke the silence on violence,0
against women from all over the world and you know as well as this um you know,0
this particular website dosomething.org have actually verified that there are between 20 to 40,0
million women across the world who are sexually enslaved,0
or are trafficked as human human trafficked people uh and and the reality is,0
that the world seems to be ignoring it to a great extent and it's slavery we fought against,0
slavery with the idea that we have the flag of,0
freedom as a part of the ownership in america but yet,0
the united states of america is the number one center for sex trafficking around the,0
world and los angeles is the number one city so my question to you here you are you know,0
dealing with you know bringing forward the women that have come forth with such,0
bravery whether it's roe versus wade whether it's all the women that came to talk about,0
jeffrey epstein or about president trump about harvey weinstein,0
but yet beyond that women are suffering across the world because,0
um so many women that i have met have talked to me about either being,0
economically enslaved whether their husband needs to see receipts for everything and one woman,0
told me that she had to hide money behind a picture frame just so she'll have a few dollars of her,0
own so many of them are sex slaves basically so and divorce for middle class,0
and working women is a one-way ticket to poverty and family laws become accessible,0
because they the lawyer they mostly it's the men who are the,0
earning spouse and therefore they can hire the better lawyer and that better lawyer is ultimately,0
potentially an employee an employer to the judge because the only time they make money is,0
when they become rent a judge how what do we do now,0
to do something to stop the demand and to stop,0
war against women well the only people who really can stop the war,0
against women are women yes and they have to,0
when they think it's the time and that's not every time it's when they decide it's,0
time they need to exercise whatever legal,0
rights they have and they have to not just suffer in silence i do represent a number of very brave,0
victims of sex trafficking of underage girls by jeffrey epstein and we have lawsuits,0
filed in new york and you know these women are very brave,0
two have taken that action but women should know nobody's gonna do this for them,0
they can only do it with them so women have to know what their options,0
are the benefits and the risks of each option,0
and then make an informed decision about what if anything they can do silence is an option living in fear is,0
an option being paralyzed by fear is an option but is that the best option,0
there are other options available to them so only when women become empowered and,0
break free of their fear and the silence you know are they going to be able to,0
help win change i always say no one has ever given women any rights,0
up to and through today uh no one ever gave women the right to vote,0
right he had to fight to win the right to vote women like alice paul in the united,0
states were arrested taken to jail for protesting,0
and fasted some people some women died trying to win the right,0
to vote uh and we are all beneficiaries of their,0
courage and their perseverance today ultimately,0
from after 72 years women won the right to vote in the united states in 1920 100 years ago it's been 97 years,0
and we still have not yet won the passage of the equal rights amendment to the united states constitution that simply states,0
that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account,0
of sex no one's ever going to give us the equal rights amendment we have to fight to win,0
it we're in that fight but there are not enough women fighting to and advocating for it,0
and of course we need supportive men as well but let's face it most of this is going to have to be done,0
by women becoming empowered so uh that's what we are,0
doing it is something that everybody needs to do something every day everybody can do,0
something every day they can devote their time they can devote their funds,0
they can uh you know get the word out on the internet or elsewhere,0
everybody can do something but because we can't do everything,0
doesn't mean we can't do anything we all can do what we can do in the way that we can do,0
it so i know you have been a very very strong,0
advocate daphna against violence against women and you continue to speak out against it and for the protection of,0
children um and so that you know we all can do what we can do but let's face it we can't just talk,0
about problems we have to get into how do we go about solving these,0
there are opportunities and options to solve some of them and so,0
even acknowledging what they are as you just pointed out a long list of injustices all of which are true,0
um that you know we can each decide what we can tackle in our own way,0
and how we can make a difference yeah no i i hear you and i think about immunity for instance,0
you know judges in family court are immune even if these women wanted to sue them,0
the most that they can do is file a complaint trump was immuned,0
well actually he's not immune from a lawsuit for certain things right and he will find that out after he,0
is no longer in office uh january 20th so uh no he may think he's immune he,0
could try to pardon himself for any federal crimes uh and i expect that he will yes uh,0
but it doesn't mean that that is going to be a valid use of the exercise of the pardon power,0
and uh and so and it certainly cannot pardon himself from any state crimes,0
so uh and and there'll also be civil lawsuits he's gonna have to face,0
he's going to be stepping into a whole new world that is something i think he fears,0
and he should fear it because it's going to be a real swamp for him it's a swamp that,0
he created he said he was going to drain the swamp but he is the swamp,0
and he's going to find himself sinking deeper and deeper into that legal swamp uh once he's no,0
longer in office are you here to speak,0
truth to power [Applause],0
and to abla and let me just say i'm here,0
to speak truth to power i'm here to speak to the president of the united states,0
who shut down the government and put more than 800 000 people out of work and i say to you,0
president trump we are going to shut down your attacks on women's reproductive,0
rights [Applause] we are going to shut down your attacks,0
on legal safe available affordable abortion,0
and we are going to shut down your attacks on trying to limit our insurance and,0
access to birth control [Applause] and your attacks on health care for all,0
americans we are going to shut down your,0
thousands and thousands of lies it's really interesting to think as of,0
him but of him in a company of men who have made it a habit,0
of thinking they can get away with sexual violence against women and you've,0
been involved in some of these cases many of these cases yes even with bill cosby you know,0
he was such a make up mega style that everybody else was so afraid,0
and women were afraid of speaking out i know my friend beverly johnson finally,0
spoke out but you gave these women the courage,0
to come forth and take a risk no matter what the consequences were,0
and i saw them i saw them broken because they were made into villains,0
and you took gave them the courage to see themselves as not as villains but on the contrary as,0
heroes and so i want you to first talk about how did you manage,0
to give all these women in the cosby case because of the statue of limitation,0
there was not much hope that they could do anything for themselves personally but,0
somehow you got them as a group to do the right thing,0
in terms of a man abusing women how did you manage that well,0
i do believe what gandhi said that you can be the change you wish to see in the world and even though for many of these women,0
who allege that they were victims of mr cosby it was too late as a matter,0
of law because of the statute of limitations that arbitrary time period set by law,0
different in every state different if you're an adult or a child when you are,0
the victim of sexual assault because it was too late for many of them to even have access to justice by suing,0
we decided you know what let's try to change the law let's try to change the statute of,0
limitations make it a longer period of time for a victim to sue or,0
eliminate it for victims of rape and sexual assault,0
so i became involved along with my clients who are my inspiration and i testified,0
in nevada before the legislature in colorado before the legislature in california,0
before the legislature and of course we did what mother jones the famous,0
labor organizer said which is don't agonize organize so we did we did,0
and we organized and we lobbied and we testified and so we were able to change the law in,0
three states actually there's a i think in the district of columbia we made a change too because i had a client there so having,0
said that there's still a long way to go but it started a ripple effect and now,0
it's happening in many other states even without our going there uh and so that's important,0
so we take women often they come to me as victims and i like to bring them to,0
the next stage which is survivors and then to the last stage which is fighters for change,0
so that's what we do and we love to see women you know doing it becoming the persons,0
that they should be learning that they have more strength and courage to win justice than they,0
ever realized that they had so it's my honor to be with these women,0
and help them to become the fighters for change that they always perhaps wanted to be,0
and now they are and now they're role models for many in their own families in their workplaces in their communities,0
in their lives i wanted to just ask you a question in a very non-partisan way i don't care if,0
anybody is a democrat or republican it's immaterial,0
we are women so my question to you is in view of the fact that all of these,0
women came forth and talked about how president trump hurt them,0
and yet in the last election 55,0
of all white women voted for trump why how does that,0
relate to who we are as women i have we not done a good job in reaching out,0
to women to white women where is the problem here i don't get it,0
well i guess they see other issues as more important in their,0
lives than that i agree with you it's difficult for me to understand i don't have the answer,0
72 million people voted for uh trump in the last presidential,0
election fortunately 80 million uh voted for the biden harris ticket,0
and so i can't tell you that there's a lot of money in the republican party that is able to perpetrate,0
a lot of lies a lot of misinformation,0
and some people just buy right into it and,0
they accept the lies they either don't know their lies or they disregard the fact that they if,0
there are lies um in any event the good news is we now have a change in administration,0
right uh and and we can make some progress it's not going to be as much progress as we all want,0
unless we can make substantial inroads in the united states senate,0
we don't know if that's going to be possible this time but it's it's key and so uh you know women themselves have,0
to be educated about their own value a lot of women didn't think women should have the right to vote they bought into the stereotypes,0
they bought into the lies and the misconceptions about what would happen if women,0
were afforded and won the right to vote so you know change has always been made,0
by a relatively few people and we do need more education of women,0
and not because women are socialized to think that they should be second-class,0
citizens um and a lot of women you know they think that having a male chauvinist in,0
their life for example is a positive whereas you know married,0
to being married to a male chauvinist or in a relationship with a male chauvinist can be dangerous to a woman's health,0
often is because the men who buy into that stereotype often will,0
you know engage in acts of violence against women uh their wives or significant others,0
um and they are controlling and often they will isolate the victim,0
and they will hurt the women sometimes kill those women uh so uh the bad news,0
is for male chauvinists that they are male chauvinists and the,0
american psychiatric association has classified male chauvinism as a certifiable mental,0
illness that's the bad news it's a mental illness the good news is it can be cured,0
so we would like those who are male chauvinists to get treatment we need to educate women about the,0
dangers of being with the male chauvinistic can seem at first exciting he's constantly calling you he wants to,0
be sure that you're okay may actually he just wants to make sure that you're not with anybody else and uh,0
and and you know he acts as though he wants to be the prince charming you don't have to worry about the money,0
and he'll tell you what to do in reference to sex you don't need to know anything and all of that is very dangerous,0
because he's trying to make you dependent and dependency can be very dangerous,0
because you lack your lack of education about your finances about your sexual life about,0
you know your your options and your resources that can be very dangerous to a woman's,0
future and her children's future those are the most important words,0
you know what you've just said is the truth that every woman needs to hear and it's,0
interesting talking about that because you then represent a woman,0
such as in the scott peterson case and you turn amber from the entire,0
population thinking she's a villain to a hero because you address,0
the real issues of what she was facing you know i'd love to know what it was,0
like for her but for you to kind of enter that and it's interesting because,0
when you and i talked one of the things i didn't know about the law,0
first of all you made me aware that an an attorney general a district attorney,0
is representing the state they're not representing the woman or the victims right and number two that through,0
not having to have the confidentiality of the court you were able to lend your,0
voice and your legal information to the outside world by virtue of,0
not having to be confined this is brilliant and i'd love you to,0
explain how does that unfold and how did it help,0
amber and in view of the fact that scott peterson may be back in court,0
what does that mean after that in any criminal case staffner,0
the prosecutor represents the people of the state not the victim the victim of the crime,0
for whom charges have been filed is often called the complaining witness uh,0
and the significance of the fact that the prosecutor doesn't represent her is that whatever she tells the prosecutor,0
is not confidential right and usually has to be turned over to the other side that is to the defense,0
so many victims don't understand that because they think oh prosecutors bringing the criminal case,0
and has agreed that i can be the victim that must mean that she or he represents me doesn't mean that at all,0
and in order to have confidentiality you have to have a private attorney most people don't have private attorneys,0
in criminal cases one because they wouldn't know where to find one to represent them two they can't afford one right and,0
three they don't understand what role they could play but in any event amber reached out to me during that,0
criminal case and so i did agree to his sister i thought she was very brave the fact that she was willing,0
to at the request of the police secretly record the telephone calls of scott peterson,0
and that was putting her life and her her baby's life in peril because she was living alone at,0
the time and if he had found out that she was doing that he could have come to kill her,0
um in any event i thought she was so courageous she deserved to be supported so,0
i did agree to become her attorney and she went from being vilified by,0
supporters of the defense scott peterson two by the end i think people understood that she was the hero of the case,0
and he was convicted there are issues now uh before the california supreme court,0
uh and we'll see what happens with this case but he is on he has been convicted of first degree,0
murder of his wife lacey peterson and second degree murder of um you know the fetus that she was,0
carrying uh so we'll see what happens um but uh yes it's something important for,0
people to know and um i also represent victims of r,0
kelly victims of jeffrey epstein victims of harvey weinstein,0
bill cosby victims victims of our of cuba gooding jr or persons who allege,0
they are victims and many others in some cases we have civil cases that i'm representing the,0
victims in as well as criminal cases so knowing options is important,0
and uh and when these women exercise their options it's not only often benefiting them it,0
also is helping to benefit other women and it's interesting because gloria steinem said that healing a part,0
of healing for a woman is actually doing something to heal another woman who has suffered from the,0
same cause which is violence against women and you you know having experienced what,0
you experienced it seems that it's a never-ending well of you helping vulnerable women and i,0
don't know if people realize that often and you said it but i want to emphasize it that often these women,0
don't have any money and they come to you because they are so desperate not to be,0
drowned by the usual approach to this kind of cases,0
and time and again you become their voice but you become,0
the voice of all women including me and i want to really really thank you from the bottom,0
oh well thank you well we you know that some things have to be done because they're right and because it's important uh that they,0
be done and so you know we were honored to represent amber,0
uh also the victims of epstein and and and we actually still have a civil case that is pending against mr,0
cosby for a person who alleges that she's an adult victim of child sexual,0
abuse by mr cosby that is what she alleges in her lawsuit that is pending in in,0
santa monica l.a county superior court and we'll soon get a trial date so we have to you know we have to you,0
know keep on keeping on you know we're talking about um the retrial,0
of scott peterson and i know you explained to me that there was some questions about a couple of the jury,0
members but um in terms of the harvey weinstein i believe he's gonna be,0
tried in california now the uh case will be prosecuted in california as,0
well as in new york uh where he was convicted in new york and uh the,0
main victim in the case for whom he was sentenced to 20 years for criminal sexual assault was,0
my client mimi haley who's very very brave and,0
uh he was also sentenced to three years for another victim whom i do not represent in california,0
uh when after he has extradited here uh the prosecution will begin next year,0
and he is also indicted here or he will be is charged here uh,0
some very serious charges of rape and um there so i represent,0
two of the alleged victims in the criminal case that will uh proceed in california,0
next year i also want to say that women should know that often they can file civil cases as,0
well it's not just a criminal justice system that is an option take sexual harassment for example,0
last year our our law firm won the largest verdict in california for one victim of sexual,0
harassment by a billionaire and the jury came back with a verdict of,0
58 million 250 000 for one victim of sexual,0
harassment that we represented a few months earlier we had another case,0
that we tried that also was before another jury in la county for another,0
victim of sexual harassment by the same billionaire and that jury awarded 5 million dollars,0
for that victim of sexual harassment so i literally want wrongdoers to have to,0
pay the consequences of their wrongs against women and that i think is a teaching moment,0
for them that they have to pay for what they've done so next time they have to think about do,0
i really want to do this to this woman what's it going to cost me maybe i shouldn't do it,0
yeah and it's funny because ultimately all of these people are narcissists the billionaires,0
and time and again those cases are about the billionaires and the thing that hurts the most,0
actually is money so you actually hurt them where it really means something that's right,0
but come on talk to you about jeffrey epstein for a second sure jeffrey epstein,0
you know a part of his entire case obviously i don't think that he actually,0
committed suicide but that's a whole other thing i think something happened to him,0
because there were too many powerful people involved but my question to you about him,0
how is it that he did this for so long he was actually,0
indicted before and got away with it and where is the justice system,0
in terms of all these women that were hurt how can they delay and not,0
deal with something that continues to hurt young women most of them are not even of,0
age well it's true that he was charged with sex trafficking of underage girls and,0
now there is even though he is deceased and there is an investigation of the condition conditions which led to his,0
death um whether and to try to determine was it homicide or suicide,0
but i will say there's also a prosecution now against a person who was alleged to have,0
conspired with mr epstein that's ms maxwell uh two sex traffic girls,0
so um there it's a long story i they obviously in florida,0
uh there should have been i think in my opinion a federal prosecution of mr,0
epstein at the time and said it was left to state authorities he got a,0
sweetheart deal back back in the i think it was 2008,0
uh and he was able to enter a plea to solicitation of,0
prostitution which is ridiculous you shouldn't ever call a girl who is a minor,0
who is a child a prostitute they're victims they're not prostitutes,0
they're not adult consenting adults let's put it that way any event that is still being,0
investigated as to why the system failed uh the victims,0
at that time but right now uh this criminal prosecution ms maxwell it's,0
ongoing her trials next year i'm representing 21 victims of jeffrey,0
epstein there's a claims procedure that is set up for them which is good uh where uh funds have been allocated,0
uh from the estate of jeffrey epstein and we are seeking accountability uh through that claims,0
procedure for many of our clients so that at least they can be compensated for what they suffered after we proved,0
what they suffered and we proved the damages and so we're happy about that because there should be,0
accountability to them and uh and even though he's deceased,0
it's not too late for them to win whatever justice is possible under the circumstances,0
you know it's it's interesting because i was talking to this incredible woman norma who is that,0
triathlon she was actually trafficked and she explained to me the whole,0
position of maxwell in this entire ring and they are called the down,0
woman the down woman is the one that befriends the girl makes her feel that this is,0
okay there's nothing wrong with doing it and then becomes part of the threatening but usually she,0
said the down women themselves have been brainwashed,0
and harassed and they are much like better women do you believe that that's true gloria,0
you know i i don't want to say what i know about miss maxwell because whatever i know it's pretty it is almost,0
entirely based on attorney-client privilege conversations and so i don't disclose,0
what my clients tell me and also i'm not there to psychoanalyze anyone i'm not a,0
psychiatrist i'm not a psychologist i'm a lawyer so i leave that to those who are better,0
equipped to do an analysis of personalities or whatever why she did whatever she is alleged to,0
have done i can't tell you all i can tell you is i look for what can be proven in a court of law,0
and then you know she certainly has a right to a fair trial but so do the victims uh or the persons,0
who allege they are victims so we'll have to see what happens well i mean i think the most important,0
thing is that we want to end on is the war against women,0
you know because it's prevalent in so many different arenas not just in the,0
justice system which are laid out before not just in family law not just,0
in sex trafficking but in the workplace women across the board many many women,0
live in fear and whereby men have boys club have we,0
you know their leaders such as you and gloria steinem who have actually been able to,0
aspire and inspire a movement of women to feel like there is,0
a ghost club and not just the boys club my question to you is what do we do to,0
stop the demand so that we don't have to go through this war on women,0
well of course fear is the weapon that keeps women subordinated right and,0
there are real risks in certain situations for women to speak out or to exercise their,0
options uh that may not involve speaking out like we've done thousands of confidential settlements which are,0
also very important because women have been able to get wind compensation through our,0
settlements and you know go on to a better chapter in their life but having said that you know,0
that is the weapon and you know we need to help women,0
learn how they can break out of their fear uh there's a cost to living in fear and,0
there's a cost to breaking out of the fear and they'll help decide which is better for them,0
uh and uh once they start do that kind of analysis often they will break out of their fear,0
uh so all i could say is we need more women in each and every aspect of life as,0
uh associate justice uh ruth bader ginsburg once said when she was asked how many,0
women should there be on the as justices on the united states supreme court she said nine,0
and and everyone said wow why i mean they were like shocked and she she pointed out that nobody was shocked,0
when there were nine male justices but the idea that somehow that there could be nine female justices,0
somehow was shocking to women that shows you how far we have to go,0
um and so i think that women belong in each and every aspect of life,0
uh i had the honor and the pleasure to have dinner with uh ruth bader ginsburg,0
actually about a year and a half ago something like that year and a half two,0
years ago at the united states supreme court and then i saw her earlier this year as well,0
and we had a wonderful chat about women's rights the bottom line is this we need more,0
women elected to office on the local level the state level and,0
the federal level to congress we need more women judges and more women,0
justices we need more women on boards commissions and agencies we need more women who to lead,0
fortune 500 businesses we need more women at you know at the top,0
in education in business in the entertainment world in the sports world uh in the legal,0
world uh in you know every aspect of life and until we have true integration of,0
women in every aspect of life we will not enjoy equality but we must keep pushing,0
for it that's the goal gloria i can't thank you enough i adore you you've been,0
a champion for all of us and we are devoted to you because your,0
voice means freedom to so many of us thank you so much stefan and working,0
together we're gonna do it as susan b anthony said failure,0
is impossible not an option failure is not an option,0
you,0
counselor thank you so much for joining me I appreciate it my pleasure we have a long history so I figured why not come,0
and do the podcast I thought it was a great idea well I love having you uh and you are a historical figure uh when it,0
comes to this country's profound interest in True Crime many many big,0
cases we'll talk about a couple of them but it's really exploded in the podcast,0
uh space and digital media why do you think that is that in this new form of,0
media there is such intense interest in one of the oldest genres of Storytelling,0
that we have it's you know it's it's very interesting to me it used to be that if you were a criminal defendant or,0
or somebody accused in the True Crime space that I used to call the cable and,0
People magazine kind of the axis of Evil for a criminal defendant there was always that Fascination I mean I would,0
talk to people people at People magazine and they would tell me that the difference in a cover story on the,0
newsstand you could directly tie to a True Crime Story as opposed to a,0
celebrity puff piece so there's always been that kind of Fascination the in the podcast world I if all you've got to do,0
is take a look at the charts I do it on occasion the Apple charts and it's amazing to me uh the the True Crime,0
Fascination in cereal and you know it's now actually making of a murderer and,0
how that podcast it's now kind of gotten into the courtroom where you know in,0
cereal there was a uh I don't know if I would call it an exoneration but clearly right there there was the most printing,0
trial making of a murderer it changed some Minds not totally but uh and with,0
Peterson the there's a newfound fascination with it we'll know sometime in February if that translated into a,0
new trial or no so Scott Peterson um charged convicted sentenced in the death,0
of his wife an unborn child was an active participant in the initial,0
search for her did media did a very uh famous slash Infamous interview with,0
Diane Sawyer one of the best in the business a mentor of mine you were involved all along the way do you,0
believe he deserves to have his conviction thrown out and get any type of reassessment it's funny you mentioned,0
the Diane Sawyer interview because I was doing a lecture the other day and they said there's nothing more painful to a,0
criminal defense lawyer to watch your clients interview get played at your trial and there's nothing you can do,0
about it as an aside I was talking about how it was with SPF that the lawyers are,0
telling him to shut the uh up and uh here and by the way he ends up getting,0
indicted in record speed in the southern district by the feds coming back to your question does he deserve a new trial yes,0
you know what happened was the Supreme Court of California unanimously granted,0
a um the appeal on the penalty phase and,0
the reason they did that is because we were objecting at the time that the judge was using the wrong standard if,0
somebody said I'm against the death penalty he didn't ask the next question which was can you set that aside and,0
still judge and follow the law he wouldn't do that he was automatically dismissing jurors who were anti-death,0
penalty so that ended up you skew the jury to get all pro-death penalty which,0
Studies have shown that tends to be pro-prosecution as well so then he should only get a new sentencing phase,0
shouldn't it okay that's what we got he got a new sentencing phase and by the way I don't think that should be the law,0
I think if you use the wrong standard and you've skewed the jury pool that,0
should go to the guilt phase but that's not apparently the law well hold on let's take a beat on it here we are in a,0
podcast which means I'm not going to cut you for a commercial anytime soon what are you talking about why AI if they get,0
the sentencing part wrong would you vacate the guilt or innocence aspect of,0
the case because what you did is you skewed the jury pool the veneer from the,0
get-go you only had people who believed in the death penalty and wanted to give,0
the or didn't have a problem giving the death penalty and you took away people who had problems with the death penalty,0
look the most important part of any trial I don't care civil criminal misdemeanor felony is jury selection I,0
mean most cases 95 percent of the time are over in jury selection I know,0
there's a lot of lawyers who will tell you it's after opening statement it isn't it's who you pick as a juror and,0
by the way let me tell you why you can be the greatest order in the world you can be Clarence Daryl Redux but the fact,0
is in any whether it's two-week trial two-month trial the one-year trial,0
you're not going to change somebody the prison to which they look at life all you have to do is take a look at our,0
political Wars here nowadays and it's very hard to talk to somebody and get,0
them to change their mind and that's the same thing with jurors so if you start a case with people who are predisposed to,0
and don't have a problem with the death penalty and you eliminate people who,0
have misgivings about the death penalty you have ceded a pro-prosecution jury,0
and that and if you say that they use the wrong standard which the court unanimously did then I think that,0
infects the guilt phase as well interesting argument I'll let you decide at home send the comments to garrigus,0
rhymes with asparagus now few questions sure one is easy for you to answer but I,0
will tell you in advance and you probably know this already it is one of the least satisfying answers that a,0
member of the bar gives to lay people those who are not members of the bar not lawyers,0
does it bother you should I get yeah guess what it is the question is how do,0
you sleep at night if you have a client that you know is guilty and you end up,0
getting them an acquittal or you're arguing for an acquittal yeah especially this guy that we're talking about right,0
now I will tell you that and uh this is not original with me it was something,0
imparted to me by my father who was a hard church between homicide prosecutor in his bank the time you lose sleep is,0
when you have somebody that you think is innocent and I know that it's not a popular sentiment but I sat there for,0
the better part of the year I knew the evidence I at the time not now but I,0
knew the evidence in real time better than anybody clearly better I think than other than the public did and I will,0
tell you that there was never evidence sufficient Beyond A Reasonable Doubt to,0
convict Scott I just didn't see it now the there was some kind of resonance,0
with white professional women and the residents was they were I could talk to,0
somebody I would be at the gym in the morning before going to trial and they would they'd say what about this and I,0
said well that's not really true it didn't happen that way and what about this and you know he was talking to his,0
lover and and telling her that he was in Paris and I'll explain well the reason he was doing that is he knew that once,0
Amber came a surface that all lies were going to be on him and they'd stop searching for Lacey and you could,0
explain everything and then at the end I would always get the same response well well I had an ex just like him and I,0
could see it and you can't argue with that that's just something that's that's visceral that I can't get that you can't,0
get around I totally get the idea that uh 100 guilty men should go free so that,0
an innocent man doesn't go to prison um and I actually believe that but I also get why it's so frustr trading,0
because sometimes you just know I mean look the most basic standard is very difficult,0
for a criminal defense attorney to deal with but you understand both sides of the ball very well is that well if it,0
wasn't him who was it because the common standard with this even what we're looking at right now out in Idaho with,0
those four students uh that were butchered um you know forget about the fact that that is a very passionate crime which,0
usually suggests some type of intimacy or familiarity with other people and the person who did it but,0
the monster scenario is a very very it's very helpful to creating Reasonable,0
Doubt but it's very rare as a homicide scenario the idea that it's a serial killer or a one-off monster who's in the,0
midst very rare over nine times out of ten if you have to find out who did it it was someone who knew who was killed,0
well by the way you hit on something that I uh that I've said for years if you have to in your closing be arguing,0
Reasonable Doubt and just Reasonable Doubt even though that's the standard even though the jurors say that's what,0
they're going to adhere to they want they want an alternative explanation yes,0
and that's not a arguably Reasonable Doubt generally is not a winning strategy even though it's supposed to be,0
in law school but people want satisfaction especially when they have to live uh with the determination I,0
would have I don't have any documentation of this but during the Casey Anthony trial when they went for,0
the death penalty after all of the confusing information about the father,0
I could tell just looking at those people they were not going to give her the death penalty because they had some questions and even if it didn't go to,0
what happened to the child they have to live with the decision to kill somebody and that's asking a lot of somebody,0
convicting somebody they can always put it off on the proof and this is what it was and even if I had doubts this is,0
what the prosecutor said and everybody else in the room said it that's different than the death penalty I also,0
tell you this at home um garrigus rhymes with asparagus was the first lawyer I had ever dealt with,0
on television who respected the difference of zealous representation as,0
manifested in the context of saying my client didn't do this my client is,0
innocent and they cannot make this case they are not making this case against my,0
client now that to me has always been actually get tingles when I say it which is odd it also could be cold in here but,0
that matters okay especially as a journalist who's also a lawyer garrigus would say and it wasn't a tell didn't,0
mean that he thought his guy was guilty but there's a difference between him saying I'm telling you this man or woman,0
is innocent okay uh they did not do this when he would say that that meant that,0
he had a case to put on that he was gonna say wasn't this guy I don't know who it was I think it was this guy but,0
it wasn't my guy versus lawyers who routinely will say my client is innocent and not only do,0
they know the guy's Not Innocent but they are pretending and I think that,0
exceeds the bounds of zealous representation I don't think a lawyer should say this person is innocent when,0
they mean not guilty corrected and that confuses I think that confuses people I,0
mean you're going to be it reminds me of the difference between when people say I got robbed or I got,0
burglarized I mean there's a there's a difference there's a difference that should not be missed and uh and it's the,0
same thing with innocent and not guilty part of the the the beauty of the system,0
is that the criminal defense lawyer why I originally was so attracted to,0
criminal defenses I'm old enough to remember when criminal defense was a,0
noble way you know to fight the government that the government was coming after your client you were there,0
and mind you people talk for years I've heard about well you know high-priced,0
defense lawyer or you you've got all the resources yet it's a rare if not almost,0
non-existent case where the defense has better resources than the prosecution,0
the prosecution has virtually like the old George Allen joke,0
um when he was with the Redskins is Edward betting Williams who's one of the great trial lawyers said I gave him a,0
blank checkbook and he's already exceeded it that's kind of the philosophy if you will of the,0
prosecution it's not their money it's the taxpayers money so they just go for it can you imagine if prosecutors had a,0
budget yeah they had to deal with a budget I mean they just it's unlimited and it's also dangerous you know it's,0
supposed to be part of prosecutorial discretion it's can you uh bring up the evidence that will make this case Beyond,0
A Reasonable Doubt and is it in the public interest to do so and I think that second part gets neglected it gets,0
completely perverted in our political process where you know people these all,0
these investigations I you know I'm very clear on this I know it's in the Constitution oversight I don't think,0
politicians investigating politicians is a good thing I don't think it creates consensus in society you almost never,0
have a slam dunk and we see what's happening now with ping-ponging investigations where the same people who,0
are outraged about the kinds of questions they were asking about President Trump and I want to ask the exact same kinds of questions about,0
Biden nobody sees the irony in it that tells you the game is broken now here's good news for us I'm not gonna I'm not,0
gonna stain you with politics because you're better than that but even though you are a member of the media now that,0
you bought those magazines what do you think I wasn't going to see that boy you used to come after me about the meat and,0
the media this and the media that and you know what really surprises me about this so-called media and I'd be like so,0
cold what else could you call it now you're in it I I'm in it because it's so frustrating to some degree I mean look,0
at what has happened what used to be kind of you talk about real crime or,0
True Crime whatever way you want to characterize it I used to get so upset about the I I probably can't even say it,0
anymore but the bleach blonde former prosecutors who were opining about the,0
cases and that kind of second guessing when they don't really know the evidence and they've not tried a case I get that,0
but that is now kind of infected that same kind of your prosecutorial,0
cheerleading has infected both sides of the political aisle and you talk about,0
the irony from Trump to Biden I'd been saying you know because I one of the cases that changed the trajectory of my,0
career was when I represented Susan McDougall in the 90s who's the erstwhile,0
business partner of Bill and Hillary Clinton and I was railing about independent councils back then it was,0
Ken star who just passed away and now we've got the same thing in reverse and,0
by the way most people on the left were anti the independent Council that it was Ken Starr trying to gouge Clinton but,0
now our cheerleading one is Jack Smith coming after Trump and if you don't see as you said the irony in that maybe,0
you're rooting for one side too hard but look I'm completely transparent I mean this you know is my podcast it could be,0
whatever I want uh and anything I don't want it to be it doesn't have to be but being back on TV at news Nation my show,0
is for dependence I say that I think the party system is a problem I think I could make that case dispositively and,0
easily it's always been attacked throughout our history started as factions and then parties and and,0
leaders have been against it forever it's not in the Constitution it's not an animal of law it's just our culture and,0
I think it's anathema to a more perfect union and I think if people leave the parties we'll be better off so I'm fine attacking them and I'm getting a lot of,0
[ __ ] for it right now and that's okay that's okay I'm willing to take that heat because it's evenly distributed and,0
I mean that's hard on my mail but it's uh it's okay in terms of uh what you,0
should be worried about which is are you being fair now there is a development that and by the way that's where I,0
learned about Council garrigus was back in the 90s um when you know he doesn't apparent,0
appear to age but uh Clinton was the first thing I ever covered in this business and it was a morass and the,0
interesting thing is one of the few things Republicans and Democrats have really agreed on in both uh counselor,0
and my life was they wanted to get rid of that independent Council statute because they said the guys could go,0
wherever they want do whatever they want but now I think it's coming full circle and the only way to do these,0
investigations is literally by getting agarragus okay say hey do me a favor will you do some public service for a,0
year will you investigate this for us because you know they don't know his political affiliation he doesn't care,0
about politicians let him tell us let someone that you respect who knows the system,0
let them investigate whatever it is no political affiliation because otherwise you'll never get consensus but there was,0
something that my daughter told me about True Crime she loves True Crimes 1920 she doesn't,0
want to be a lawyer um at this point which is good Mark's uh daughter is a very well established,0
criminal uh defense attorney in New York City she said that the big problem that you,0
would have in Trials because she knows this at 19 is that they'd say well I saw on TV that you should have DNA evidence,0
that shows this net that was really hard for people they would expect instant answers because of what they saw in Law,0
and Order but with this digital wave now people get how difficult it is and that,0
you're not going to get a fast thing and there are almost all circumstantial and I think it may help the jury process,0
that if they're into true crime in the podcasts they're getting a much more realistic take on how hard and subtle,0
the process is than they did from TV well it's interesting take a look at what Barry Scheck and his group have,0
done for um exonerations DNA exonerations I said,0
that to me to my mind you could give credit to that for giving people pause on the death penalty,0
I think that that was one of the reasons I think that you're starting to see with,0
these podcasts on True Crime people are starting to say well wait a second here and doing what there's one to do you're,0
in juror is not to be I've always complained about Stealth jurors who have an agenda but a juror is supposed to be,0
widely as I explained to them where we pick it you're supposed to be a judge of the facts you're pretend you're wearing,0
a robe for the facts the judge will give you who's up there on the bench will give you the law but you're to be on the,0
facts and part of the being a judge on the facts is to be skeptical you're supposed to go in there and not have a,0
dog in the fight you're supposed to look at it look at the witnesses judge whatever's presented to you with a,0
skeptical eye and that's the job and I think that's one of the good things that,0
have come out of podcasts there's a long form or at least the longer form you know part of the problem used to be you,0
do what a a hit on cable news at night and it's a two or a three minute segment,0
podcasts you get a long form version where people start to discuss it and if,0
you're interested in it and you're focused you start to get a more nuanced view of what was really going on as,0
opposed to kind of what was fed to you in a three minute or a four minute or even an eight minute clip yeah that's,0
the good side the bad side as I told my daughter and is definitely true now garrigus is the first step into True,0
Crime and I mean this is it's not like he and I are taking apart a case but um I haven't done any of it on the,0
podcast um because I hate to succeed no because I wanted to focus on a political,0
dialogue that I think is important to happen I've always uh really appreciated crime and journalism because it's the,0
perfect narrative it's made for Once Upon a Time you have great minds invested with resources and giving you,0
at least two different versions of the story and it's great because as a beginning middle and an end and their,0
consequences and it's relatable so you know crime has always been a lustful thing for any Storyteller but my problem,0
with the podcast now that I'm looking at it to figure out what space I can carve out for people is these people make [ __ ],0
up they just make things up I'm looking on the Idaho case now yeah because the guy at the truck knew this and knew that,0
one and knew that's just not true so yeah I finally get through to the one of the investigators off the Record,0
and I was like so this guy knew the thing and he said where'd you get that I said well I uh saw it on the one of,0
the and then I called myself I was like am I really about to tell this guy that I saw it on Tick Tock and I you know I,0
was like if somebody sent it to me he's like listen just because somebody says something confidently doesn't mean they're saying,0
it confidently which I thought was a great great line it's a great line I just so then I started looking they just,0
make things up about what they think may have been true so Casey Anthony now,0
they do this uh series everybody complains should you be doing a series on Casey Anthony uh should you do a,0
series on Jeffrey Dahmer well if you want to watch then isn't isn't that the answer I,0
haven't seen it I had to watch a little bit of it because we were going to cover an aspect of it but people are very,0
upset about it and it's such an interesting thing I think to get your take on that this line of should you do,0
a Dahmer series that makes him somewhat sympathetic in terms of what he went,0
through that made him a monster which is what he was um or Casey Anthony she should get paid,0
to tell her story you and I lived through Casey Anthony from the,0
standpoint I was commenting on it and I know Jose well and um think the world of him but you know,0
ABC your old employer as I remember licensed pictures in that case for 250,0
000 which I think ended up making its way to the lawyer to defend ring when,0
people make the argument that she shouldn't be able to do this number one she was acquitted number two you know,0
the Son of Sam at so-called laws across the country there's a patchwork of them have not really stood up real well I,0
mean a post-conviction there's restitution orders which is a different thing but there's a free speech,0
component and there's the ability to to tell your side of the story I mean she didn't get on the stand and testify and,0
she laid low which I think was a smart thing but it's the there's whether it's,0
Casey Anthony or Scott Peterson or any of the others that you can think of that,0
you know the so-called Trials of the century that happened that used to happen every year during sweeps and,0
weeks in uh in May there is a story to be told in people as you accurately said,0
are fascinated by it because it does have a beginning middle and end it does,0
give rise to arguments or a give and take and that's part of the nature of uh,0
of a community or a tribe and it's almost always relatable to a dynamic in your own life not to mean that all of us,0
are a step away from chopping somebody up but that you know people like this they look like people you know the,0
Dynamics of where they live you know there's usually some kind of of hook and,0
as soon as Sam Law is just so you know at home that counselor is referring to so Son of Sam you know who that guy was,0
in New York City right and he did all those horrible crimes they passed a law that you shouldn't be able to write a book and benefit from your own crime uh,0
and that money should be given to the victims as counselors calling restitution um that is an arguable legal premise it,0
sounds good feels right but doesn't mean it's going to have constitutional sufficiency,0
um and the ABC case was very interesting ABC got exposed for paying for materials,0
to tell the Casey Anthony story it was outed by the media who had lost in the bidding exactly which I found,0
very interesting you know this is the problem with your competition being your critic base in the media so other people,0
were bidding on it they just didn't win and no I wasn't bidding on the thing it's not like I'm trying to defend myself I don't have any problem with the,0
practice and I'll tell you why this is going to be controversial should you pay people for their story no,0
easy answer right ethically no okay but you will make a fortune exploiting,0
their story and telling it in different ways on different shows and different times and specials and everything else and you'll make a fortune doing it,0
that's okay but they get nothing even if they wind up being acquitted they get nothing now that makes it a little bit,0
more confusing doesn't it and I've always seen that gray space when people would say to me especially in the Oprah,0
Winfrey in the daytime TV days started coming up they started paying people for their stories they were like well why should I go on with you and not her when,0
they're going to pay me I never had a good answer to that there isn't a good answer to that no I would say well that's daytime TV this is news but it's,0
all blurred now it's all you know person by person I remember the controversy where we were representing Michael,0
Jackson um in CBS use 60 Minutes to interview,0
him for the noobs and at the same time um had his special from the,0
entertainment side of arm of CBS and they paid a very large sum of money for,0
that special and there were people who were trying to link it together and the late great Ed Bradley was denying the,0
connection and uh you know I'll I'll leave it at that Ed Bradley May rest in peace I live in his front yard,0
um from where his home was uh they have since sold it but I knew him he was very good to me we went to the gym together,0
and he was in a Sticky Wicket in that one because he was forced to cover for the corporate interest and that's always,0
a problem and it's always going to be one and the media is always going to have an owner right it's it's always as long as it's a business so,0
um I'm gonna let you go because you're pressed for time but I will say that this was enjoyable thank you I'd like to have to continue this discussion I would,0
like to continue the discussion here uh and on news Nation you're always welcome I have tremendous respect for you and I,0
look forward uh to following the legacy of just one of your cases with Scott,0
Peterson but you're always welcome anywhere I am and I wish you and the family the best but I do I appreciate it,0
you the same Mark garrigus Grimes with asparagus [Music],0
What do you think?,0
that was really fun I think that we're going to do more of this talking about what matters within different criminal,0
investigations and trials from the perspective of people who understand the strategy involved what do you think let,0
me know you know how to comment our thanks to mark garrigus my thanks to you please subscribe please follow and,0
please remember that free agent merch own being an independent I'll see you next time,0
most people think there is no cause for,0
crime except the pure cussedness the,0
ones they call a criminal but as a,0
matter of fact that the cause for,0
everything in this world and there's no,0
way to remove the evil without removing,0
the cause there's a cause for all sorts,0
of human conduct just exactly is it a,0

poverty ignorance hard luck after you,0

what we need is efficient humane,0
