you should know assuming yeah welcome to Nobel week Stockholm yeah and all Nobel,1
laureates yeah I were asked to bring a thing an artifact to the Nobel Missy in Stockholm yes so what did you bring yeah,1
I loved these true things yeah I I won't explain now those are,1
gift from my colleagues last year I got this and this is a miniature of 27 years,1
ago on me and they III didn't know,1
though that was a secret that I I was got I got this one after such that to,1
celebrate her party in Spanish they gave me this quiet it's very very cute yeah,1
and this is the way you do your research Oh always I yesterday I said the,1
probably the origin of my world the first I found the phenomena and for,1
me that was a starting point of my work and so I like microscope you to use to,1
see something and I believe the discovery of this some sort of a,1
phenomena is most important for biology still I think oh yeah so many my,1
colleague knows that so they gave me,1
this miniature this is their my for a 27 years old so I had a black back here but,1
it's very much like you yeah thank you that this one yeah and those ones either,1
yesterday I told about what is ATG gene,1
and this is a 8212 it's a big thing like molecule,1
bound to 80 zhuhai and combined by a tg16 diamond so this is the first we,1
solved the structure of a t12 5/16 body,1
to end this one was also present from a colleague two years ago or something,1
this is exactly another you became like molecule this molecule the homeowner of,1
this molecule in moment is so called lc3 that is very important molecule for,1
research so those I brought otherwise I,1
don't have many any special things so I,1
was thinking and when you were born in 1945 in Japan it's a Skype kind of a,1
When were you born,1
rough time then oh yes but I did they do,1
not remember because I was so young so then then when I was young boy Japanese,1
recovered so quickly everything is goes up so my young age,1
were up to probably still graduate still,1
undergraduate that everything is quite positive period then I yeah then we have,1
now because now we have worth some sort of their mature,1
society and and we have many earthquakes right like volcanoes,1
yeah different so I yeah with you everything is not so stable yeah I never,1
saw that kind of thing when I was young I was wondering and when you were a young boy what did you picture yourself,1
When were you a young boy,1
doing as a grownup yeah probably probably I said yeah I have no talent to,1
drawing or sports or something yeah probably I have not so many choices okay,1
yeah my father was a process person took,1
Kyushu University and my parents probably expected even beat Society for,1
me yeah it's not yeah it's not that,1
far-fetched for ya Yin but you started out studying chemistry and then you,1
Switching from chemistry to biology,1
switched to biology yes that okay a little bit I said in the mixture I you,1
understand the chemistry is so as a long story and also I established so when I,1
went to the Tokyo University chemistry,1
lecture was not so stimulate dip for me but that time as I said the molecular,1
biology that period and everything is so fresh for me and it was so fascinating,1
movie so I want to be a molecular,1
biologist that there is nine I have know,1
for example in high school age I haven't take powers ecosphere lecture but,1
immediately I interested in the world I was under graduate school so was it,1
Inspiration,1
any particular person that inspired you oh ma I care about yeah yeah yeah yeah,1
probably I want saying that extra that was very,1
good time for me so Justin and every,1
they were for example genetic code as,1
the spring so ATG means or without me or,1
that kind of things I was so excited to,1
me so that was that of course I learned about the near bar coach or something,1
yeah that's my issue of their molecular biology yeah,1
according to your experience what personal characteristics are valuable to,1
Personal characteristics,1
a scientist what do you need - I it's,1
not sterile type of research I'm,1
probably I'm not typical why not I don't,1
know I I like as I said I'm not a,1
competitive person and I want to study,1
something I interested but many many,1
successful scientists do not behave like like me yes but I hope every not not on,1
the scientist our society should have,1
heterogeneity at a very important for human yeah so,1
and what a difference the ampulla needed yeah so even scientists we should have,1
many types of and this I I don't know,1
what should be I don't want to say this is a most typical or most important way,1
to use that science also you have yeah that might have been even worse I yeah,1
Research group,1
and you're still running a research group the you said that it's important,1
with different kinds of scientists do you think like that when you in your team do you do you also have different,1
yeah it's so of course when I started,1
notoriety just important things what's going on buy more for your am study and,1
then genetic stock and then work your biological research study so even though,1
Auto Fuji yeah we should focus some,1
thread up their subject during my 27,1
years so but my I hope my lab health are,1
heterogeneous people just doing this research you know to resolve their own,1
prophecy so someone should be molecular,1
iris somewhere genetics number biochemist good luck biochemist some,1
cell biologists yeah I won't have were quite heterogeneous people in my in my,1
home do you still do your own experiments Oh sometimes I try but it's,1
very difficult yeah we need some constant in time so I started some some,1
day but I should give up to continue so,1
it's a I cannot say I'm doing but I research by myself yeah I was,1
thinking if we turn to your discovery mmm so this is you can okay say yes is you,1
show it to the camera like that that's a very schematic yeah yeah yeah picture,1
what it Otto Ferdie yeah might be but you show that Otto Fuji which is self,1
eating and it's not only a way of degrading material it's also about,1
recycling mm-hmm so why does ourselves need a system for,1
recycling okay I always said for example,1
if you stop if you know not have any,1
hood it's quite often a challenge in,1
nature for example you can see many TV programs out there polar bear could,1
cannot get any food for several days and many many you can have that candle lion,1
even lion cannot get so in their pollution any starvation is the most,1
challenge two daughters - so we should have their recycling system at the,1
beginning of their our life so I think for example if I we one day starvation i,1
I don't know what I heard the our people,1
cheering - 70 percent of the bell volume Wow yeah that means the autophagy is very,1
important for our whole body labor to,1
the auto Fuji and degrade that they are one protein and I mean I said surprise everywhere in,1
your body and especially for brain hmm and quite interestingly if you start our,1
body every cell most almost all part of,1
our organ starts out of it but only,1
brain doesn't so that means playing the lab system is so important so first they,1
are protected for starvation that means they're other for example liver it's,1
also important for some survival,1
yeah so I believe there's recycling it's,1
a very important yeah I die I want to emphasize yeah and if you're if you are,1
Worst problem,1
cell cell too much a tougher D or too little what is the worst problem for sale,1
probably yeah as I said of course so the recycling problem with for,1
example our auto festival to be so cannot survive under starvation,1
condition that means the recycling is a very important for survival and also as,1
yesterday autophagy has another function to get rid of the harm for excessive,1
must be years so if you have defect in,1
notify see many harmful protein or shampoo or dangers organ accumulate in,1
ourselves that is also very dangerous for life so both of us if,1
now we know what the fidgets effect has many many defecting health or disease,1
problem that many people interested in and out of the G that's one of the most,1
important yes and because we talk about recycling in nature and the environment,1
there are some materials in our environment that are not easily degraded,1
or recycle and you know plastic things that end our lives is the same thing in cells or the particular materials that,1
are hard to degrade and recycle yeah probably in usual case lysosome has so,1
important activity to degrade almost everything so but we know many many,1
lysosome disease that cannot delayed for examples specific proteins or specific,1
molecule those are all those call goes there some sort when he serious problem,1
of health we long long time who we know are many many lysosome disease but we,1
didn't have any autophagy disease probably autopathy is more fundamental function,1
so probably both of if you have a severe outfit effect they cannot survive so we,1
didn't have any specific disease world autophagy that my I think that that,1
might be maybe just here this should be,1
like in a mammalian cell because this is Eliza salmon and it's encapsulating,1
there things that should be and here it's yeah like but you did you research that's why we had this little,1
factory your favorite organism yeah the jeast and so okay yeah no that's why we bought,1
that yeah okay first I will explain yeah the auto fudgy most important event is,1
how to seek a star potion was height so,1
o to into autofocus moon yeah but no nothing was known about the,1
molecular mechanism forming designed with strategy so so that was the thing yeah yeah I so we need probably we need,1
quite good model system then when I,1
started I was working on the back you it not like though we have only this kind,1
of big it compartment and eyes my eye my,1
eye assume this must be homologous to,1
the lysosome so I want to know if this,1
is really the data compartment how this material come across the membrane so I,1
thought meaning we are doing some sort of membrane biology yeah but I they're,1
beginning my starting point versus found this kind of structure inside about you,1
and then electron microscopy of this,1
process the probe this is exactly the similar phenomena shown this and of,1
course lysosome is much much smaller than vacu but you can see all of,1
some performed two and then she was with me tea compartment and hydrolytic enzyme,1
attack the inner membrane structure so,1
when you were looking like this at what point did you understand that you had,1
made a breakthrough discovery but what was there yeah,1
when I told this is a electron,1
microscope but I just sold this phenomena under write more a microscope,1
and I thought these structures are moving around in the vacuum yeah,1
graduate is structure accumulating the backhoe and that was so it reached me,1
quite fascinating phenomena so I was convinced I might have a real yeah in,1
someone what was the feeling in your heart at that time yeah yeah that was the really,1
probably most exciting and in my life yeah yeah you mentioned that before but,1
Starting a career today,1
he said that one reason why I started to study at offered you was that you don't,1
feel that you're very a very competitive person so you choose that kind of field yeah so I was just wondering if you were,1
starting your career today yeah what field would you yeah I many times I,1
asked a similar question yeah I always say probably if I'm now I may not study,1
out of us because it's is so popular and many preprinted of course their auto,1
body is just a general word for many,1
many autophagy against analyze a structure,1
biology well and cell biology in many many way but probably is so popular so,1
I'm want to make another subject to a,1
while welcome but yeah like watch was what extent yes I always say it I was,1
too old and for me always say even in,1
East we know about 30 percent of the mystery of the auto fission is probably,1
less than 30 percent Nima marion autophagy so there are many many things,1
to analyze father so in that case i,1
might start off Papaji in some aspect of,1
the prophecy I don't know being a,1
Frustrating times,1
researcher can sometimes be frustrating yeah I understand yeah,1
and did you during those frustrating times did you ever think of giving up,1
just quit and do something completely different,1
yeah,1
I'm not so hard to have a good result so,1
I have not so much pressure to do of,1
course one reason is auto fudgie is so new field and not so many people working,1
out of me so I was really happy every single is new for me yeah so but we,1
example when we started the cloning of 80 genes we had everything's are noble,1
and we haven't get any answer to what they are doing so that was the very,1
frustrating time and I didn't so much,1
worried about but many people say at that time,1
you always complain now under science meeting we have so travel unhappy,1
yeah it is voting so for how long time did you endure without getting into,1
T12 system,1
results but yeah we found a t12 system,1
and within two or three years we got many many new findings then so from them,1
everything is a some sort of there we should to get information about the G,1
protein and how they are working in the cell so we have many many problem should,1
be solved so we started yet exactly that,1
way but probably I'm balanced and I want to be know what is really what was he,1
doing nice so I couldn't pursue that,1
kind of for a long time because I have so many things to do so now I go what the,1
original questions now in my lab so I what is working on earth,1
what independent how about our materials,1
is degrading life is over vacuum that much yes Christian my house you,1
Technical skills,1
mentioned that when he will little your mother had technical skills and one of,1
the first things you got to know what's about the streptomycin yeah yeah yeah,1
but you never did you never were interested in being a doctor oh yes I know if I so many very good,1
risk doctor at that moment probably I,1
think the medicine is one of the most,1
important field but I don't know that,1
wasn't the case yeah you like to look at the stars and nature yeah you are now I,1
Advice for younger scientists,1
mean you mentioned that you've been struggling yourself yeah and but now you were about to receive the Nobel Prize,1
and very successful and so do you have any piece of advice for younger,1
scientists that are now in the process were you worried for what yeah unfortunately I saw the special in Japan,1
but I heard I met Swedish scientist yes,1
they were that day before yesterday also they feel it is not so good time for,1
basic research because,1
a little bit younger generation in Japan,1
for your example professor fifty or,1
sixty they it is not easy to get the money told they should write the grant,1
application every time and also it's not so easy and they feel very competitive,1
and also many many other administrative job things happen to me here to them so,1
they have not good time to concentrate on science so young generation watching,1
their P I they looks not so happy when I,1
was yeah so I hope I want me change that,1
kind of situation and but for young,1
generation yeah if you these days what,1
happened for them is a you should have a good paper when you have undergraduate,1
school or postdoc you should always pushed their fish to have a big general,1
paper or something yeah but it means if you you should work on popular topics,1
because it is much has a chance to get,1
nature science or a cell paper but so it,1
is very difficult to stick on their new,1
subject but thank you dear yeah so my advice to the young general,1
if you really have you can believe you,1
can have good results and as many many income very competitive few you let go,1
but if you really interesting something something you had better keep that,1
question yeah so don't hurry or you had,1
better finder phenomena you can continue,1
five years ten years twenty years thirty seven years yeah yeah that's my advice,1
Family,1
finally we have talked a lot about your work and you will carry you but when it,1
comes to life outside of the laboratory mmm and what is important to you yeah,1
probably in my case my wife took care a lot to me,1
and I should appreciate her help and,1
yeah it's very difficult to do everything so nicely but now I won't,1
happen for tab and more relaxed times so,1
it's earth yet attacking for me I was,1
just thinking maybe I haven't been your family and your relations had been important for for your scientific,1
achievement yeah yeah probably my I had,1
two sons but they didn't when entered and science will probably they watch me,1
thank you very much ok time domo arigato got so much,1
How did you receive the news that you have been awarded the Nobel Prize?,1
the first message I received from another foundation was by telephone call,1
it was around the 5:00 p.m. of October 1st and actually people told me,1
something happens maybe before 4 o'clock so we are completely free out of these,1
things and we're concentrating with my colleague about the our paper in the,1
manuscript editing and suddenly my secretary came with some stiff face and,1
nope that they opened the door and you have to take the phone so I was not so,1
sure what's going on something bad or good I took the phone and the person,1
recording was said dr. Perlman so I made it to catch the point and then I had a,1
very nice and pleasant conversation but often I heard there is a fake call and,1
so of course he also mentioned I asked him to send the email to just confirm,1
and I won so I received the email it was real and so we told everybody in the,1
love and of course my family and other kind of the good exciting,1
celebration - I mean the nice picture. And the picture we took then was posted on,1
the website of the Nobel Foundation so it was a very exciting and a pleasant,1
and unforgettable incidence in my life,1
Why did you decide to become a scientist?,1
there are several reasons first I have to decide whether go to medical school,1
or law school or several other choices of course I went to medical school are,1
strongly influenced by my father and also I mean the family reason and,1
secondly I read the biography of Hideo Noguchi who was the very interesting,1
doctor with the United States in his 20s and become professor in the Rockefeller,1
Institute and he found these ciphers as a cause of the policies and also he died,1
in Ghana during his study on the yellow fever pathogen so that was very striking,1
and I went medical school and the other reason I've had a friend only a father,1
and son and he died of the stomach cancer very acute and I was very much,1
you know very sad and I thought what I can do anything,1
for this type of the diseases,1
Can you describe the main impact of your discovery?,1
so cancer immunotherapy has been I mean idea has been around many decades before,1
Jim Allison and myself demonstrated in the above system the reason why many,1
people failed one after another is they didn't realize the immune system is,1
already suppressed by the tumor growth so if we push the accelerator of the,1
immune system while the immune system is under the strong brake there is no way,1
they can drive the immune system forth and only the people find the major,1
immune negative regulator means a break that was say therefore and pd1 and Jim,1
Allison first showed say therefore blockade can cure the cancer in animal,1
model and soon after we found a pit I mean the we found a pity one before but,1
we demonstrated pd-1 blockade can also cure the cancer unfortunately the pretty,1
one is less toxic video and blockade I mean and has chronic and now it used in,1
a wide spectrum of tumors starting from melanoma lung cancer renal cancer,1
stomach cancer meaning that's slightly advantage of the PD one over C therefore,1
C therefore has a very strong activity and sometime too strong,1
also a bit side effect is stronger I received many prizes of course before,1
How does it feel to do work that saves lives?,1
the novel prize and this is a probably last prize I get but I felt when I see,1
the patient and saying they were saved by the therapy we developed is the most,1
moving and also the time I feel my life has some meat so that was the very very,1
you know unforgettable and I was so very touchy and I feel I feel about it I'm,1
Can you tell us about some of the cancer patients youâ€™ve met?,1
not the clinician but I've involved some clinical trials and the one lady who had,1
a big tumor this is ovarian tumor and doctor of,1
course thought hopeless but she recovered and there was almost five,1
years ago and treatment lasted one year and she is still tumor free and enjoying,1
her life one time I saw she playing golf so there was a real amazing and similar,1
story I pray golf myself and I have a friend,1
who told me this is my last round in my life because I had lung cancer but,1
if what about maybe half a year was so later he came back and I just started,1
the treatment you developed and he just completely cured was fantastic well,1
Do you have a message for those who are fighting cancer today?,1
unfortunately the our treatment is still not complete only 20 to 30 percent our,1
responders and we have a long way to go but now this is the just beginning and,1
many many scientists in the industry jumped in so I hope this therapy of the,1
or widely used and reach to the almost everybody in the world hopefully by the,1
end of the century just like the infectious diseases almost,1
completely eradicated in during the last century,1
I hope the century will be remembered at the century of the cancer treatment,1
that's my,1
Do you think that diversity is important for fruitful research?,1
yes I think so,1
always especially in the life science we don't know exactly where is the best,1
target nobody knows which mountain we should crime we have to try many things,1
so for that purpose everybody has to think different idea and have to,1
discussion so diversity are including everything gender nationality different,1
culture maybe age you have some very brave young people very brave that's,1
good and each people has more experience and that's very important well to make,1
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?,1
yourself a good scientist I always say first you have to have curiosity if you,1
don't have any curiosity you better choose something else and then we so to,1
be good scientists we have to solve something new so something new usually,1
not easy because it's difficult that why it remains unknown so you need enough,1
courage to tackle this difficult problems and you need a courage and that,1
is a challenge so challenge with courage and I call this three primary see and,1
then once you decide to tackle you have to concentrate and continue,1
and the eventually you build up confidence so this is another three see,1
that's my what I tell to my students I,1
How have you maintained your curiosity?,1
never tried to keep my curiosity it comes from inside when I learned,1
something in you I always oh this is quite interesting but why and curiously,1
just endless it comes from inside,1
Who has most inspired you?,1
well there are civil level as a general science the first incident I was,1
enchanted of charmed by the years Natural Science is the very tiny tiny,1
ring around the Saturn which is watched through the telescope at the elementary,1
school that was first I got very much interested want to be astronomer and I,1
read many books but then later switched the medicine because I read a biography,1
of a Hideo Noguchi and the second very critical moment maybe the time to come,1
back to Japan so I was another big choice in my life whether I stay in,1
United States keep going and many people advised to stay but I,1
decided to go back to Japan that's 74 other kind of turning point in,1
both cases I was very fortunate my decision was,1
correct or correct because I made something retrospectively well for my,1
Was there a specific moment that sparked your interest in science?,1
science I have so many important mentor or advisor the first mentor Osama,1
Hayashi who discovered oxygen gas oxygen directing cooperation into the organic,1
compounds gave my solid background in science and also international fearing,1
science has to be international it's not the local thing and the next person who,1
opened my eye to the molecular minerals is Donald Brown of Carnegie Institution,1
of Washington and without him I never go into this particular field and then I,1
went to very latest laboratory where I actually started this antibody,1
diversification so those three are very important during my scientific career,1
How did you stay focused on your research for all these years?,1
well I didn't have any resistant fortunately my parents very supportive,1
in a very different psychologically and financially they support it and then the,1
my family a wife and children I was kind of work Holly I don't spend much time,1
with my family I feel sorry for them but they just allowed me to concentrate on,1
the my research so I'm very fortunate so playing golf I completely forget about,1
Youâ€™re a keen golfer â€“ do you do your best thinking on the golf course?,1
the science and I concentrate but the the reason why I like golf game it's not,1
a competition it's kind of the fight against yourself,1
for example if you hit a bad shot you get angry but you get angry against,1
yourself and always you have to think very carefully because every time you,1
hit the ball run into different conditions sometimes grass thick,1
sometimes you know different weather and you always have to think but it's a,1
different type of challenge but I can completely forget about my science and,1
it's also very enjoyable,1
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement?,1
for scientific career I think I made two major contributions one is the I found,1
the molecular mechanism for the antibody diversity namely antigen induced,1
antibody diversity class switch recombination and somatic mutation and,1
this pd-1 break discovery and its application to cancer immunotherapy but,1
these days I'm still working so I'm very much pleased this of my two lines now,1
coming to very close because can see me no therapy depends Lots on your gut,1
microbiota and gut microbiota regulation depends on IG a secretion and the,1
molecule I discovered for antigen induced memory AI D does I found another,1
important molecule and do two molecules collaborate to maintain our gut,1
microbiota and this is important for homeostasis and also anti-tumor immunity,1
so that's my scientific contribution but for for the person life I had a family,1
and two children fortunately both doing well some is the medical doctor,1
physician and daughter is the embryologist working science field and,1
what's rest I also served the administration in the medical school,1
and I also served as the scientific adviser to the Prime Minister almost 10,1
years ago and I don't know whether I made something through this type of the,1
administrative work but at least I tried to improve scientific environment,1
What was your childhood like?,1
so,1
you know i have uh two brothers and two,1
sisters,1
so um we have a large family and,1
especially when we were young of course,1
that,1
that involved a lot of chaos uh and uh,1
we had a lot of freedom at that time you,1
know,1
children now seem to have very scripted,1
uh lives,1
and whereas we had a lot of freedom uh,1
basically you know,1
you go out of the house in the morning,1
let's say in the summertime and you come,1
back in the evening for dinner,1
um and nobody's expecting to see you in,1
between,1
so um yeah it was uh it was a lot of fun,1
uh to grow up in that kind of an,1
environment,1
Was there a particular teacher that inspired you?,1
for my i would say for my my career,1
inspiration i was very fortunate to have,1
a,1
high school biology teacher dr rose,1
nelson and,1
she was a phd so she had done research,1
had done,1
post doctoral training and um,1
she taught us biology not as a series,1
of you know sort of facts but,1
she would teach us about discoveries and,1
about scientists who made,1
discoveries and the sort of the,1
excitement of,1
of learning something new in science and,1
that really excited me,1
she also recommended to me a summer,1
program,1
at a research institute where i was able,1
to,1
experience research firsthand um and so,1
all those experiences really,1
um really excited me and,1
developed a passion in science that i've,1
had ever since and,1
so i really i really owe that to her and,1
it's it's one of,1
my regrets you know that she passed away,1
before this time because um she was a,1
very,1
uh very positive person and very,1
ambulant,1
joyful um so she always had a beatific,1
smile on her face,1
and and she would uh she would be,1
teaching us something and she would say,1
now i want you to remember that when you,1
win your nobel prize that you learned,1
that here,1
and she said this you know not to me to,1
you know,1
to the class and she would say this as,1
as a statement of fact so i don't know,1
how she knew,1
but she was really a remarkable teacher,1
Why did you become interested in genetics?,1
well i guess you know the idea of of,1
hereditary,1
passing down of traits and how this was,1
determined by sequences within the dna,1
you know it is it's kind of a very uh,1
amazing thing right to go from these,1
molecules to,1
um traits of of of living organisms,1
and that really interested me and uh so,1
i was,1
uh first interested in genetics sort of,1
a basic,1
uh genetics and thought i would do you,1
know sort of basic genetic research,1
uh but while i was in college a family,1
that we knew had a child born with down,1
syndrome,1
and i became interested in medical,1
genetics and decided that,1
i would try to get training both as an,1
md,1
and a phd so that i could do both,1
genetics research and medical,1
genetics as a clinical specialty,1
How do you deal with failure?,1
right well when i was a college student,1
i worked in a lab,1
in boston and the the,1
leader of the lab he would always say,1
search and research,1
because that's the nature of science,1
that um there are always obstacles to be,1
overcome experimentally and um,1
and that's a challenge and if if that,1
isn't something that's enjoyable to you,1
then probably science is not is not a,1
good line of work uh,1
because we're we're constantly uh faced,1
with those kinds of,1
obstacles and challenges and uh,1
you know part of the fun of the work is,1
uh is using our,1
our creativity to come up with solutions,1
to those kinds of problems when they,1
arise,1
persistence is a a very critical uh,1
attribute absolutely and then the other,1
part of it that,1
is very helpful is to have colleagues,1
who take orthogonal approaches,1
to the science so they may look at the,1
science in a slightly different way,1
and and and may provide an avenue,1
for uh circumventing various obstacles,1
um and so when we were trying to um,1
isolate the the dna sequences that,1
uh coded for the uh the subunits of the,1
hypoxia inducible factors,1
we we took one approach uh because we,1
thought that there was only,1
um one one protein that was,1
involved and we took a approach that,1
involved,1
um screening uh human dna sequences in,1
bacteriophage,1
and we screened millions and millions of,1
these uh these clones and we,1
we got negative results um so you know,1
as the leader of the research,1
project it's sort of my role to decide,1
what to do so you know we could um,1
continue,1
doing what we were doing and that didn't,1
seem like a very good idea,1
we could give up and let someone else do,1
it that didn't seem like a very good,1
idea,1
either or we could take a completely,1
different approach which was rather than,1
a molecular genetic approach,1
to take a biochemical approach and try,1
to purify,1
the protein through uh biochemistry,1
and this was not exactly our forte so,1
you know we owned none of the equipment,1
that was required to purify proteins,1
did not really have the expertise to do,1
that uh,1
but fortunately across the street at,1
johns hopkins was the lab of uh,1
tom kelly and his lab was one of the,1
first labs to purify a protein,1
based on its binding to dna and so with,1
the assistance of his lab,1
we were able to do that to purify the,1
protein,1
uh from 100 liters of cells,1
growing in culture and to get just,1
enough of the protein that we could,1
obtain some,1
protein sequence and then use that,1
protein sequence,1
to identify the dna sequences of what,1
turned out to be the two subunits of the,1
protein,1
so in fact the approach that we had been,1
taking would never have worked,1
uh because that approach only works if,1
the protein has a single subunit,1
and because our protein turned out to,1
have two different subunits,1
um only through the purification the,1
biochemical purification,1
uh would we have been able to succeed,1
How important in freedom in science?,1
and,1
you know so again you know the the,1
freedom and the creativity these are the,1
really,1
fun parts of the job that no one no one,1
tells us how to do,1
our work and as long as we're successful,1
you know we're left alone,1
and and we can do our thing um and so,1
to have that freedom to uh not only,1
with regards to you know problem solving,1
but even more fundamentally what,1
questions do we,1
ask you know what what are what are the,1
really important questions that we'd,1
like to answer,1
um that's that's left entirely up to us,1
uh and and obviously that changes over,1
time,1
um and so you know we started with a,1
more with sort of more basic fundamental,1
questions,1
and then uh over time have shifted to,1
more applied,1
uh applications uh as the project has,1
evolved,1
and uh so that's been very satisfying,1
over the course of uh 30 years to be,1
able to connect the dots to very,1
molecular fundamental questions how does,1
a cell,1
sense the oxygen concentration and,1
respond to changes,1
all the way to you know can we develop,1
new treatments for anemia for cancer for,1
cardiovascular disease,1
and you know as someone trained both in,1
research,1
and medicine you know for me it's always,1
i've always felt it was my role to,1
bridge between the basic science,1
and the and the clinical translation and,1
so you know it's been very satisfying to,1
reach that point,1
where um uh we we see these,1
uh translations occurring now uh as a,1
result of these basic discoveries that,1
were made,1
25 years ago,1
Have you ever doubted yourself?,1
that's a good question um,1
well i guess i yeah i doubt myself often,1
um you know i often doubt uh you know i,1
might am i taking the,1
the the best approach uh uh,1
am i uh running the lab most efficiently,1
um and uh you know am i uh,1
am i mentoring my students well enough,1
could i be doing a better job at that so,1
yeah i i,1
i guess i have those kind of doubts or,1
self-criticism,1
on a fairly regular basis,1
How did you discover you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?,1
well i was uh i think the word is,1
dumbfounded,1
so uh you know it was of course in the,1
us it was the middle of the night,1
and uh i was sleeping very soundly and,1
the phone rang,1
and uh well you know when i finally was,1
uh awoken,1
out of the sleep and got to the phone in,1
the hallway,1
it had stopped ringing so you know again,1
i was not even really awake yet and i,1
figured well maybe this is somebody's,1
idea of a bad joke you know because i,1
didn't know what day it was,1
um so i went back to sleep and uh,1
actually quite a while later the phone,1
rang again i said perhaps i better be,1
quicker this time so i got to the phone,1
and uh you know thomas perlman,1
apologized for waking me up and then you,1
know gave the good news and,1
you know i i was sort of on the phone,1
and uh you know my jaw just dropped and,1
i didn't really words weren't coming out,1
and of course my wife was there uh and,1
she could hear what,1
was being said on the phone and her jaw,1
dropped and she couldn't say,1
save much either so we were just kind of,1
mute it was a very one-sided,1
conversation,1
Can you explain your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery?,1
well you know everybody appreciates the,1
importance of oxygen right i mean you,1
just have to hold your breath,1
and you'll start feeling uncomfortable,1
very soon right because you have a,1
hundred trillion cells in your body,1
and they all need oxygen on a continuous,1
basis,1
uh you know principally to make energy,1
which,1
allows us to you know for this complex,1
organism,1
to function right and the body uses uh,1
glucose and oxygen in order to generate,1
energy,1
and so there has to be but by the same,1
token,1
oxygen at two higher levels causes,1
damage,1
to cells so the the there has to be a,1
very,1
tight coordination between supply and,1
demand,1
so the the amount of oxygen that each,1
cell requires,1
uh has to be matched by the delivery of,1
oxygen which is of course carried by red,1
blood cells,1
through the blood vessels to each cell,1
and,1
so so there's a beautiful you know,1
physiological system that maintains the,1
balance,1
between consumption and delivery of,1
oxygen,1
in every one of the 100 trillion cells,1
in your body under um normal healthy,1
conditions,1
uh and of course that balance is,1
disturbed,1
by many common diseases including,1
cardiovascular disease and cancer,1
[Music],1
What practical applications does your work have?,1
yes so you know the first uh translation,1
of the discovery of this system to the,1
clinic,1
is uh the development of new drugs for,1
the treatment of anemia,1
so we started by studying uh,1
the hormone that controls red blood cell,1
production called erythropoietin or,1
epo uh and uh uh,1
patients who have a chronic kidney,1
disease the kidneys stop,1
making ippo and they become anemic and,1
the discovery of epa was a revolution,1
because it,1
enabled the patients to receive a,1
recombinant epo protein as an,1
injection to stimulate red blood cell,1
production,1
but of course uh it's a recombinant,1
protein,1
and it has to be injected and uh now,1
there are in development uh,1
uh drugs that uh induce the activity,1
of the uh the factors that we identified,1
the hypoxia inducible factors that,1
control epo production and these drugs,1
can be given as pills by mouth,1
so that um,1
the the treatment of anemia can be,1
you know made much more convenient for,1
patients both with kidney disease and,1
other causes,1
of anemia and there are you know four,1
different,1
drugs that are all in advanced clinical,1
trials now over,1
25 000 patients are are being,1
studied in these trials uh and uh one of,1
the drugs has already been,1
approved for use in china and japan,1
and you know will probably be approved,1
in the u.s and europe within the next,1
year or so,1
if you know if if everything goes well,1
so that'll be the first,1
um application of our discoveries to the,1
clinic,1
uh uh another area so,1
you know in in that context uh the the,1
hypoxia inducible factors,1
are uh as i said play an important role,1
in in physiology,1
and uh when they're not be when they're,1
not produced in sufficient amounts we,1
would like to stimulate that,1
but in cancer the factors are produced,1
at very high amounts because,1
oxygen becomes very limiting in cancers,1
because the,1
the cells grow so rapidly that they,1
basically,1
outgrow their blood supply and become,1
very hypoxic,1
and uh and this can lead in fact to the,1
the cancer cells dying because they,1
don't have enough,1
oxygen which of course you'd say what's,1
bad,1
about that it you know that's what we,1
like cancer cells to do to die,1
but of course the cells that are very,1
far away,1
die but those that are closer they can,1
survive,1
but their exposure to low oxygen changes,1
them,1
makes them more invasive and metastatic,1
more difficult to kill and uh and,1
and we believe these cells are are,1
really,1
cells that are very dangerous in terms,1
of the risk of,1
the cancer spreading through the body,1
and resisting therapy,1
and pretty much all of the cancer,1
therapies are targeted to the,1
cells around blood vessels that have,1
lots of oxygen that are rapidly dividing,1
uh whereas the hypoxic cells,1
are not really targeted by any therapy,1
and we think that,1
if we can inhibit the activity of the,1
hypoxia inducible factors,1
in the hypoxic area of the cancers that,1
that will complement the existing,1
therapies,1
and lead to you know a better outcome,1
for patients with,1
advanced cancer and uh so,1
there's a uh a hip inhibitor that's now,1
in clinical trials for kidney cancer,1
um so i think we you know we've already,1
started down that road as well,1
when i say we i mean the the scientific,1
community and the pharmaceutical,1
industry,1
recognizing the importance of this area,1
for targeting in different diseases,1
Is there a good balance between basic and applied research in medicine today?,1
most applied research,1
comes from a foundation of basic,1
research,1
and what i mean by that is that the,1
basic studies are often done,1
just trying to understand a system and,1
and the properties of that system,1
without directly saying we want to,1
target this particular disease because,1
that tends to be less effective,1
than to say let's just learn about the,1
system,1
and by doing so over time it'll become,1
apparent how we might target the system,1
therapeutically,1
uh and so really that's uh that's how we,1
started just,1
with very basic fundamental research um,1
and and it's led now to i think many,1
applications,1
being apparent that that again will take,1
time,1
to unfold but will hopefully result in,1
new treatments for a number of different,1
Diseases,1
How did your upbringing influence your path to science?,1
my upbringing,1
possibly shaped me as a scientist mostly,1
because i was fortunate,1
i did not influence this i was fortunate,1
to be born,1
into a family which was,1
relatively mindful compared with many,1
american families which are mindless,1
my parents who were not at all,1
scientists,1
but nonetheless they were well educated,1
they graduated from college during the,1
depression,1
which was very rare for american adults,1
and then they got as is often the case,1
when you,1
achieve an education they got mindful,1
jobs,1
my father was a newspaper reporter my,1
mother was a school teacher,1
these are these are white-collar jobs,1
not,1
labor and so the atmosphere in the home,1
was,1
relatively mindful without being yelled,1
at by my parents to,1
do well in school or something it was,1
just a good atmosphere which to,1
be raised and that made me realize,1
when i was a baby that school,1
education is not torture it's,1
interesting,1
it's not just a chore a daily chore,1
and i really liked my science courses in,1
high school for example,1
and that made me,1
interested in going on to college to try,1
to become a physician a doctor,1
but halfway through college i lost,1
interest in that,1
totally but,1
in many american colleges if you want to,1
become a physician,1
an md you major in uh,1
you say we major that's a verb you major,1
in biology,1
that's what i was doing so i just stayed,1
in biology,1
no more pre-med interest and i just,1
decided to go on in biology,1
after college but,1
all of this did go back to being in an,1
atmosphere my father,1
for instance taught me sports,1
and we went to many sports matches,1
of many kinds that was very interesting,1
i spent way too much time,1
wallowing in sports but he told me i'll,1
never forget it one morning he said,1
will you stop going to the sports pages,1
in the morning paper,1
initially every morning read the front,1
of the paper,1
sometimes for for example,1
to not just to be a typical american,1
adolescent teenager where you're a,1
you know boasting about the fact that,1
you don't know anything and that school,1
is is ridiculous,1
and not cool so,1
that that's what influenced me to,1
i mean when if you're a researcher in,1
science without necessarily boasting,1
it it's a mindful occupation you have to,1
know things you have to learn,1
about factors and phenomena and,1
technology,1
it's very valuable to read,1
what we call the literature in your,1
field to,1
not just to keep up but because it's,1
often interesting,1
and and so this so i had a,1
similar vocational experience to my,1
parents,1
who for a total of almost 100 years of,1
time had mindful jobs,1
obviously if you're a journalist you're,1
not,1
cutting down trees in a forest it's not,1
physical labor,1
it's it's words and ideas and,1
events and same with a schoolteacher my,1
mother taught english,1
Do you think itâ€™s important to have a mentor?,1
i i found it,1
to have a mentor which i had two,1
crucial mentors in my time i was very,1
fortunate,1
i didn't realize at the time how lucky i,1
was i had a mentor in college,1
uh which there was that's very rare that,1
mentoring even in the old days was,1
in colleges very low level,1
stuff but this guy was a genuine mentor,1
he was a,1
very well-regarded researcher nationally,1
and even internationally,1
but nobody at the college knew that he,1
was ridiculed,1
because he could not be a member of the,1
regular faculty,1
because he had gone deaf as a young man,1
in the 1930s,1
he was a graduate student in this this,1
is relevant to this year's nobel prize,1
he was a graduate student working under,1
alfred sturdivant,1
who in turn worked under thomas hunt,1
morgan,1
the first drosophilas to receive the,1
nobel prize i didn't know this,1
at the time but he was,1
i was doing a little research project,1
under this man his name was,1
phil ives and instead of,1
solely instructing us how to do the,1
project which is trivial,1
undergraduate he also,1
self-consciously told the people working,1
under him a small number of students he,1
was not permitted to teach classes,1
he was just a researcher and he was,1
regarded very poorly everybody said you,1
have this job,1
as a charity because you went to that,1
college when you were younger and you,1
grew up in the town,1
in the middle of massachusetts and usc,1
and they said you got a charity,1
acceptance to the college,1
and then you got later a charity job,1
because you were deaf,1
and nobody would hire you for the,1
standard,1
phd biology job and so he was looked,1
down upon,1
very minor character ostensibly in this,1
biology,1
department as it was called but he was,1
the,1
about the only one actually doing any,1
research but he was,1
superb at,1
uh cranking up enthusiasm and motivation,1
for the small number of students working,1
under him doing,1
minor research projects but also he said,1
i want to teach you,1
all you students you trio or quartet,1
what he called the lore of drosophila,1
how it all started where and how when,1
which went back to his academic,1
grandfather who was,1
by then the famed thomas hunt morgan the,1
first drosophilas to be awarded the,1
noble who would have ever imagined,1
morgan himself when he started in 1908,1
09 1910 would never have imagined that,1
their genetics findings,1
would come to be regarded as so,1
so significant which they were,1
and he was the boss even though he,1
the people who knew morgan knew that he,1
didn't wasn't really very good at what,1
he was doing,1
but the boss gets awarded the prize,1
not not the,1
actual researchers who is a famed trio,1
of his students who are some of the best,1
biologists in the history of biology,1
sturdivant mueller who won the nobel,1
prize in the 40s,1
and then there was a calvin bridges,1
another superb geneticist,1
everything that the three awardees this,1
year have done,1
we could have done none of it ever if it,1
hadn't been for those three,1
drosophilas working under morgan morgan,1
was such a flake,1
that he he started studying fruit flies,1
because he wanted to study,1
cell biology and development not,1
genetics,1
he never heard of genetics very few had,1
at the time,1
[Music],1
What sparked your curiosity about our daily biological clocks?,1
it was that what sparked my interest,1
this is a,1
another remarkable coincidence which,1
i would have never was strange and very,1
helpful,1
in retrospect uh when i was a,1
taking a course in college,1
one of the teachers in the course,1
had was a wet behind the ears assistant,1
professor,1
as we say he just started a faculty job,1
he went from his phd work at princeton,1
in new jersey,1
immediately to a faculty job that was,1
common at the time,1
later you had to do postdoctoral,1
research for two,1
four not typically five seven years,1
before you can get a faculty job he went,1
straight from his phd,1
and so what well the so what with that,1
he had worked on drosophila,1
rhythms for his phd under a then famous,1
rhythm researcher this was not genetics,1
it was just rhythmic biology,1
and so this guy was teaching a course on,1
evolution,1
about which he knew nothing it was not,1
in his background,1
so he put into this course on evolution,1
a module,1
about drosophila rhythms be,1
out of desperation but it was very,1
interesting,1
it was not germane to the course he,1
still works at that college and i,1
became much more close with him,1
professionally and,1
personally later on and i talked about i,1
said,1
his name is bill zimmerman i said bill,1
i don't know if you were doing more than,1
you knew to us students when you were,1
teaching us about rhythms,1
but it was nonetheless just,1
intrinsically,1
interesting so i started to learn about,1
daily rhythms which i never heard of and,1
one way to learn about daily rhythms,1
in animals or anything is via the early,1
days of fruit fly research,1
studying rhythms albeit not genetically,1
but then after,1
college and then after grad school i,1
i went to caltech to be a postdoctoral,1
because that was becoming,1
more and more necessary and one of my,1
lab mates was the person who started the,1
entire,1
genetic approach to studying rhythms he,1
was a grad,1
student there in that lab at caltech and,1
and i got to know him very well because,1
we had personal,1
interests that overlapped,1
in rock and roll music and profanity and,1
beer drinking and,1
but in addition he had done this phd,1
thesis,1
research on rhythm on genetic,1
taking a genetic approach to study daily,1
rhythms and i perked up because it was,1
superb research,1
as such but also i i understood,1
what he was doing and why because i had,1
by a pure,1
coincidence been exposed to rhythmic,1
phenomenon,1
a few years before in drosophila there,1
there's a drosophila,1
species called drosophila melanogaster,1
that's the species which is studied,1
in such a heavily genetic manner which,1
has led to five nobel prizes,1
melanogaster but there's another,1
there's many drosophila species and one,1
of them believe it or not is called,1
drosophila,1
pseudo-obscura it's only pseudo obscure,1
apparently,1
and it's the species that was used going,1
back to the,1
middle of the previous century and,1
before,1
the species used to study rhythms,1
although not genetically,1
because you can't there's not much,1
genetic background,1
involving pseudo obscure it's all,1
melanogaster that's the species that,1
morgan,1
lab pioneered and started to generate,1
all this,1
genetic information and genetic,1
materials,1
there's more known about drosophila,1
melanogaster,1
than the sum total of all genetic,1
knowledge,1
about any organisms any and all,1
organisms,1
and of course the genomics is completely,1
known in drosophila melanogaster,1
that's the species they chose to do,1
genomics,1
in terms of fruit flies because there's,1
so much,1
additional genetic knowledge going back,1
more than 100 years,1
nobody uh uh nobody knows this nobody,1
needs to know but,1
morgan somebody at morgan celeb noticed,1
an anatomical anomaly for one individual,1
fly back in 19,1
before just before 1910 some people,1
claim it's the famed white eye mutant,1
that's false it was a mutant on the back,1
end of the fly which had an,1
anomalous slightly anomalous appearance,1
it was a mutant called with which says,1
nothing,1
and that's long disappeared nobody,1
studied it much the white eye mutant,1
became,1
famously studied by morgan,1
himself and especially his students,1
in fact one reason that the first clock,1
gene,1
that was identified molecularly could be,1
identified was because it is located,1
very near the white gene and that part,1
of the,1
fruit fly genome in melanogaster is one,1
of the most,1
heavily studied subsets of the genome,1
there's vast amounts of genetic,1
knowledge,1
about it which permitted it to be,1
isolated molecularly,1
so this is another example of how,1
our predecessors unbeknownst to them at,1
the time and unbeknownst,1
to us when we were doing it we couldn't,1
have done anything,1
without all this background,1
Is circadian rhythm a sort of sixth sense for living on earth?,1
we're not aware of all of our senses,1
we're aware of,1
sights and sounds and visual inputs,1
we're not aware of another sense which,1
is the sense of balance,1
which is a mediated by sensory,1
and central nervous system and by a,1
loose analogy,1
what you said about rhythmicity being,1
something of a sixth sense we're unaware,1
of our daily fluctuations most of them,1
but they seem because they're so,1
widespread,1
for a given organism and among organisms,1
they're so ubiquitous that they seem as,1
if they must be,1
important and it must have been,1
important for life,1
when it arose on this planet over three,1
billion years ago,1
to cope with,1
the location of this body in the solar,1
system,1
some people and many scientists are,1
aware of,1
the revolution of the earth and changes,1
in,1
seasonal changes and also the rotation,1
of the earth,1
which creates these relentless 24-hour,1
cycles,1
and and so to cope with mostly,1
fluctuations between light and darkness,1
which occurs in most parts,1
of the earth all year except like in,1
northern sweden,1
um but some people say wait a minute,1
these are changes in the seasons i say,1
yeah but the cycles are still,1
24 hours yes there's different amounts,1
of darkness,1
in the winter compared with the summer,1
like here when it gets dark at three,1
there are 1500 should have it,1
but it's still a 24-hour cycle and it's,1
relentless,1
and so it seemed as if to cope with,1
these relentless environmental cycles,1
that the origin of life had to so code,1
Did the universality of clock genes pave the way to the discovery?,1
[Music],1
that's a cavalier argument that can be,1
made,1
about the fact that the clock genes and,1
clock,1
mechanisms are so similar,1
from microbes to mammals which is,1
one of the consequences of our,1
kick starting a molecular genetic,1
approach,1
which then people are found similar my,1
god these fruit flight clock genes are,1
everywhere,1
and there's not 700 of them per species,1
there's maybe a dozen core clock genes,1
that's tractable that can be figured out,1
knock himself when he was finding his,1
he found three remarkable mutants out of,1
two thousand tries,1
that's better than zero but what if he,1
found,1
four 400 what do you how do you cope,1
with,1
this avalanche of novel,1
it was just three tractable,1
and that's how the whole clock molecular,1
genetics,1
story unfolded he said it is a,1
crucial uh dozen or so,1
low double figures worth of clock,1
factors,1
genes and their products which are,1
proteins which are acting and,1
interacting,1
to form and operate the daily clock in,1
cells,1
including ourselves including especially,1
in our brain,1
so this was we are fortunate to study a,1
phenomenon which is a,1
interesting and be tractable,1
what if we were going to have to deal,1
with a network of,1
hundreds of interacting genes we would,1
be,1
floundering around for decades and but,1
we could,1
platform my god when mike mike young who,1
did,1
amongst the best work we all put our,1
findings together we said my god you,1
know we have something like,1
70 mutants but,1
and they could define 70 genes which is,1
a nightmare,1
but the 60 70 mutants defined,1
10 genes that means when you,1
hit a gene and get a novel rhythm,1
problem with your new mutant it's a gene,1
that which was hit before,1
and he said wow,1
and that's that's just a good fortune,1
because we didn't set up the,1
organisms to be that way we had to find,1
out if that was the case which we did,1
all along the way finding out more than,1
we ever intended,1
but the whole thing was just extremely,1
good fortune all the way back to when,1
this guy,1
taught me about rhythms because he,1
didn't know anything about evolution,1
which was the course,1
[Music],1
How would you describe your collaboration with Michael Rosbash?,1
well we were we met,1
in the middle of the 1970s shortly,1
before he came to,1
brandeis university i had already come,1
there,1
a short time before we met he was going,1
to join the faculty one about one half,1
year after i did,1
and he came to meet me when he made a,1
trip,1
to kind of help him gear up to start his,1
job a little later,1
and he came to meet me i never heard of,1
him he was just a post-doc,1
nobody's ever heard of those people and,1
he,1
told me that he was coming to brandeis,1
to do research in molecular biology,1
study populations of dnas and rnas,1
rnas being the primary gene products and,1
i knew about that kind of research,1
because i had been instructed about it,1
when i was in grad school,1
i found it very interesting and so it,1
wasn't like he said i'm going to study,1
this,1
and i might have said in another,1
situation,1
i don't know what you're talking about i,1
don't care go away,1
no i said oh that's interesting i'm i'm,1
glad there's going to be somebody on the,1
faculty doing that work,1
and he said well i hear that you work on,1
fruit fly genetics,1
and behavior genetics and neurogenetics,1
i said yes that's what i'm trying to,1
start doing,1
he said well but none of that's,1
molecular i said no,1
of course not it can't be it was the mid,1
70s,1
he said but maybe we maybe we could join,1
forces,1
later in life and,1
merge my molecular expertise with your,1
genetic biological neural behavior,1
i said sure let's pencil that in,1
for eight years,1
astoundingly we did,1
start to work together in the early mid,1
80s as he,1
imagined but at the time when he,1
proposed this upcoming conceivable,1
scenario,1
it did not and could not have had,1
anything to do with,1
anything particular but what we mutually,1
decided to do was to join forces to work,1
on rhythms,1
genetically and molecularly um,1
but along the way we were fortunate we,1
we got to be fairly close as colleagues,1
and friends,1
because this is similar to me in the,1
great ron konopka,1
ross fish and i had similar outside,1
interests,1
especially sports and especially,1
profane misbehavior which we did,1
often in the planned ways and thought it,1
was very funny nobody else did,1
we did and sometimes spontaneous,1
misbehavior and uh and pop music,1
and getting together in groups and to,1
carouse and drink beer and watch sports,1
and movies and,1
and so along the way in the through the,1
70s into the early 80s,1
we couldn't help occasionally mention,1
to each other about research related,1
matters,1
that had to do with his interest and my,1
interest and i,1
i couldn't help mention to anybody that,1
i knew about,1
konopka's incredible breakthrough in,1
in the caltech which i knew about,1
and i've gotten to know konopka quite,1
well personally,1
but neither raspberry at the time 70s,1
had,1
any interest in doing these things,1
anything having to do with canopicas,1
genetic what we call chronogenetic,1
discovery,1
taking a genetic approach to study,1
rhythms and,1
potentially to study the clockworks,1
which happened and nobody even knocked,1
himself couldn't have imagined that,1
where it would go 80s and beyond,1
in part because kanopka left science,1
prematurely,1
retired when he was in his 40s of all,1
things,1
but anyway so when we decided to work,1
together we had a personal connection,1
and rash himself couldn't everybody,1
would agree that what konopka had,1
done and found was fascinating we said,1
let's,1
springboard off that which is what mike,1
young independently did the same thing,1
young knew about kenobi's discovery,1
back in this late 70s when he was a grad,1
student,1
and he independently said gee if this,1
rhythm genetic biblity boo is going to,1
really,1
mean something more broadly,1
more broadly based and deeper it's got,1
to go molecular,1
it can't be just mutants and rhythmic,1
attributes alone it's got to go,1
molecular which is correct,1
i mean every imaginable i mean jesus the,1
nobel prize awarded to drosophilas in,1
the mid-90s this,1
stemmed from mutants but it was because,1
those,1
mutants pointed to genes which went,1
molecular,1
that those three were awarded the nobel,1
prize,1
they went molecular in fruit flies and,1
then people used those,1
molecular materials to found that there,1
were similar genes,1
all over the place and that's why the,1
work of those three drosophilas,1
became so significant,1
involving work that they didn't even do,1
but they promoted,1
in starting with this humble little,1
insect and that's the same thing in the,1
rhythm business,1
our the clock genes identified in,1
drosophila,1
people now were starting automatically,1
without even thinking about it looking,1
for molecular relatives,1
in other like mammals and not expecting,1
to find them maybe they didn't even want,1
to find out what they did,1
so our work became much more significant,1
than we would have ever,1
imagined at least in part thanks to the,1
work of others,1
who went to school on our findings and,1
materials,1
i i found it a privilege to study,1
rhythms because they're so interesting,1
they just,1
are for i think for anybody,1
that lots of science is gibberish,1
rhythms are not to go to work we were,1
trying to do,1
serious rhythm studies on a given day,1
but,1
in the back of our minds if we had any,1
minds was that,1
this is just enjoyable to study,1
something that,1
is truly interesting biological clocks,1
daily rhythms every day all day and the,1
next day and the next and the next and,1
the next,1
and it the more i got into rhythm,1
research the more i realize that they're,1
universal,1
every category of organism has,1
biological clocks so,1
and some phenomenon of course,1
are limited only to certain types of,1
organisms,1
they're esoteric rhythms are not,1
Necessary,1
Official interview with Svante,1
foreign,1
Where does your passion for science come from?,1
for science come from so I,1
really don't know where my passion from,1
science comes from I think my initial,1
passion was much more for ancient,1
history or archeology here in Sweden,1
where I grew up and for egyptology where,1
my mom took after my mom took me to,1
Egypt when I was 13 or 14 years old and,1
then later I came to science and,1
realized that one could fuse aspects of,1
science with this interest for our past,1
both historical past events and,1
evolutionary paths,1
Was there a particular person that influenced you?,1
was there a particular person who,1
influenced you,1
so I think the person that was most,1
important to me when I grew up was,1
clearly my mother since I grew up alone,1
with my mother in a suburb of Stockholm,1
and I think what was very important was,1
that she well she had a sort of great,1
respect and passion for school work and,1
learning and she took my nerdy interests,1
very seriously when I got interested in,1
ancient Vikings or so she took me to the,1
museum she would take me around to look,1
at runic Stones around the Stockholm and,1
measure them right up what was on them,1
and so on and then she took me to Egypt,1
and where I discovered sort of,1
fascination of with ancient Egypt and I,1
think,1
one thing that also my mother gave me,1
was probably sort of taking life as it,1
comes because she had of course been,1
uprooted by the second world war in,1
Estonia and had to flee to Sweden and,1
arrived here in 44 when she was 18 years,1
old or 19. and many many of her,1
classmates did not survive the war,1
so I think a little bit she took,1
sort of every day as a gift as I think,1
all of us should do actually,1
"How important are teachers, and a good learning environment?",1
how important to teachers and a good,1
learning environment,1
so I grew up in Burger Boston uh,1
part of Stockholm where one at that time,1
at least was not necessarily expected to,1
go to university and I think it were a,1
few teachers for example that was were,1
quite important to me I remember a,1
teacher of physics at Paris who,1
also noticed my interest in ancient,1
things and would even he collected,1
Antiquities and took your summer long,1
and showed me at a school for example,1
and this thing of feeling that your,1
interest was taken seriously by your,1
teachers was quite important,1
yes and I think it's important in a more,1
research setting I think to try to have,1
an atmosphere where everybody in the,1
team can have ideas that they bring in,1
that you're not afraid of saying,1
something stupid or so that you,1
realize that nine of ten ideas that come,1
are probably wrong and stupid but in,1
order to get that tense idea that's,1
really brilliant you have to have an,1
atmosphere where all the things are,1
brought to the table all ideas are,1
expressed,1
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?,1
teased you need to be a successful,1
scientist,1
that it was hard to say what do you need,1
to be a successful scientist because,1
there are if you want many different,1
things that you need to come together,1
perhaps and they're also very different,1
ways to being a successful scientist,1
there are some people that are extremely,1
smart for example and that is important,1
there are other people that are very,1
knowledgeable and really learn from what,1
other people are done there are people,1
that bring together combinations of,1
knowledge that otherwise no one brings,1
together that can be very fruitful I,1
think one cool thing with science,1
actually is that there's not just one,1
way to be a good scientist,1
What do you enjoy about science?,1
what do you enjoy about science,1
well then if you then think about,1
science it's of course driven I think by,1
questions and interests you have for,1
example to sort of see if we can go back,1
in time and see how our genomes or DNA,1
sequences have changed over time,1
but then once you Endeavor on that of,1
course science is is a collective effort,1
so it's very much a social thing where,1
you work in a group try to assemble the,1
people with different competences and,1
make sure that these people get along,1
with each other and that one can,1
together sort of work towards a goal and,1
that's in a way what I find probably,1
most stimulating every day is,1
this going together after something,1
How are competition and collaboration related?,1
how a competition and collaboration,1
related and then many people talk about,1
competition in science and in some sense,1
I don't think that that's,1
an important factor it's a human,1
Enterprise competition comes into it of,1
course but it's not the driving force,1
for us I think it's really going after a,1
question and competing with yourself in,1
a way trying to do is as well and as,1
quickly of course as you can,1
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?,1
to a student,1
student,1
and it's sort of hard to say what advice,1
would you give to,1
the younger scientists that enter the,1
field I think following your passion and,1
your interests is important because it's,1
generally automatically the case that if,1
you're really interested in something,1
you tend to do it well just because you,1
put in a lot of effort because you find,1
it really interesting so you should,1
follow the things that you are,1
interested in then at least you have a,1
good time while you do it what's to say,1
How do you cope with failure?,1
how do you cope with failure and of,1
course there are sort of many challenges,1
and failures and setbacks on the way,1
I think if you hold your sort of gaze on,1
what you want to achieve you can sort of,1
overcome that rather rapidly because,1
generally start thinking about the next,1
experiment what can you do to sort of,1
and you always live in the Grand,1
Illusion that the next thing will solve,1
everything that you do,1
What are the key implications of your research?,1
what are the key implications of your,1
research and our research is then,1
curiosity driven if you like we want to,1
find out what happened to our ancestors,1
in the past,1
so we have been able to study the,1
genomes of our closest evolutionary,1
relatives neanderthals and we discovered,1
distant relatives and Neanderthals that,1
lived in Asia the Denis Evans and found,1
that they contributed to the gene pool,1
of people today that many people today,1
if your roots are outside Africa carry,1
genetic variants that come from these,1
earlier forms of humans and that these,1
variants genetic variants influence our,1
biology today influence our,1
susceptibility to disease or our sense,1
of pain or many other things,1
What's the relationship of Neandertals to modern humans?,1
what's the relationship of Neanderthals,1
to modern humans and of course now when,1
we have the genome our closest,1
evolutionary relative,1
we can sort of look for genetic changes,1
that are unique to neanderthals and that,1
are unique to fully modern humans that,1
happen in our ancestors during the last,1
half million years and spread to,1
everybody almost everybody today so we,1
can have this catalog of sort of the,1
genetic changes that make our genome,1
unique,1
and a research direction that is now,1
becoming very exciting is to try to,1
understand which of these may have,1
functional consequences,1
which of these changes May influence,1
things such as why modern humans became,1
millions and eventually billions of,1
people spread over the entire planet to,1
spread over open Oceans Where You Don't,1
See land on the other side and came to a,1
point today where we influence much of,1
the biosphere actually,1
What makes us uniquely human?,1
what makes us uniquely human,1
can of course asks what makes modern,1
humors unique and that is these things I,1
think that we and not these other forms,1
of humans became very numerous started,1
having technology and culture that,1
changed very rapidly and and became so,1
numerous that we probably just absorbed,1
these earlier forms into our population,1
at least that's probably a large,1
part of why neanderthals for example,1
disappeared we are beginning to learn,1
so I think the really big question is to,1
understand in the future what that may,1
have been it could have been even,1
something more about sociality that we,1
have the ability to form big societies,1
and transmit much of our knowledge to,1
the Next Generation that in reality,1
humans are quite unique in that we spend,1
almost the first third of Our Lives,1
absorbing all the knowledge that,1
previous generations have generated and,1
then we build on that so some people,1
talk about this ratchet effect that in,1
each generation we sort of develop our,1
culture and Technology further so I,1
think somewhere there is probably in the,1
future going to be the key what's that,1
modern humans apart so much,1
How did you celebrate the news of your Nobel Prize?,1
how did you celebrate the news of your,1
Nobel Prize when there was an,1
announcement of this at the beginning of,1
October it was a great surprise to me I,1
must say,1
and was a surprise I think to many,1
people in our Institute and to many,1
people in in the field I think it feels,1
so good also because it's sort of a,1
recognition of this entire research,1
field,1
um and yes there was a lot of,1
celebrations also in the Institute,1
immediately actually taking place and it,1
was amazing how many people take who,1
wrote to me people from far back in my,1
life that took this as an occasion to,1
contact me again and that was a lot of,1
fun how is it returning to Stockholm to,1
"How is it, returning to Stockholm to receive the prize?",1
receive the prize,1
what should I say emotional to be back,1
in the city that I grew up in,1
unfortunate to say my mother is not,1
around anymore to experience this and,1
it's of course a sort of amazing feeling,1
also to realize that exactly 40 years,1
ago my father received the same price,1
here,1
foreign,1
[Music],1
Will anything special happen when you return to Germany?,1
will anything special happen when you,1
return to Germany,1
well and so when I have survived this,1
week here we will have a party for for,1
the institute at the oldest techno club,1
in East Germany actually which is not,1
far from our Institute The Distillery in,1
leichtig,1
What environments help with creativity?,1
what environments help with creativity,1
an amazing thing in my career I've been,1
the opportunity that came in the mid 90s,1
to take part in the founding of this new,1
Max Planck Institute in Leipzig in East,1
Germany,1
and there was a chance to think about,1
how should one create an Institute and,1
how should one do anthropology in the,1
future,1
so the question that we sort of United,1
The Institute from many many disciplines,1
that moved there was around what makes,1
humans unique in different genetically,1
biologically behaviorally and so on,1
and it was also a chance to create a,1
building and an environment to bring,1
people together,1
and of course science is very,1
International many people come from all,1
over the world to work with us and have,1
much of their life in the Institute so I,1
think it's also seen very important to,1
sort of have things like a sound on the,1
roof or a climbing wall or things you,1
can do together things that are not,1
about the science that you can do,1
together to bring people,1
to talk to each other all to people from,1
different disciplines that work in,1
different departments why is diversity,1
Why is diversity â€“ of all kinds -in science important?,1
of all kinds important in science often,1
what is important for the progress of,1
science is to bring different,1
perspectives and opinions together that,1
can be very useful to bring people with,1
different backgrounds and experiences,1
together it's often in the sort of,1
combination of disciplines and,1
knowledges that new things emerge that,1
said I think it's very important that,1
each individual is very rooted,1
in their own area of expertise and then,1
interact with other fields so to say,1
they have to be expert in something to,1
appreciate what the other people do can,1
Can you tell us about the object that you are donating to the Nobel Prize Museum?,1
you tell us about the object that you're,1
donating to the Nobel Prize Museum they,1
of course want you to donate some object,1
to the Nobel Prize Museum here,1
and after some thought I decided to give,1
them two books sort of dictionaries of,1
science that my father gave me in 1971,1
when I decided to not study science in,1
in school and rather go for Latin and,1
ancient things it was a little,1
disappointed with that and gave me these,1
books I think to sort of say I should,1
keep at least an ion science still,1
so they sort of remind me about that yes,1
that happened I did come back to science,1
and it's sort of a little link back to,1
my dad also,1
Foreign,1
Did you always plan on studying medicine?,1
I can remember the day of choosing,1
medicine the headmaster rather austere,1
figure came into the chemistry classroom,1
and said Ratcliffe could I have a word,1
and I followed her out of the classroom,1
he said Radcliffe I think he should,1
study medicine he wasn't the sort of guy,1
you challenged so I said yes sir and,1
that's what we did we struck out,1
chemistry and wrote medicine on the,1
University forms and that's where I,1
ended up in medicine I've liked it,1
although we never quite knew whether he,1
thought I would be bad chemist good,1
chemist or about doctor and to be,1
perfectly clear I don't think we know,1
that now well I think medicine has so,1
What do you enjoy about medicine?,1
many facets I've done several of them,1
I've worked in in research in Discovery,1
Science as you know and that's why I'm,1
here today but that wasn't my medical,1
part I trained as a kidney specialist,1
I've done a lot of acute diagnostic,1
medicine that's quite fascinating quite,1
challenging I enjoyed that bedside,1
teaching of medical students I think,1
it's a breadth of of Medicine that,1
that's so fascinating there's the,1
science of course is quite a different,1
way of life and I had the great good,1
fortune of being able to practice,1
medicine and be a scientist,1
How do you deal with failures?,1
we're just carrying on I'd have to,1
correct the first people have asked me,1
were there you Rica moments in your work,1
there were there were several they were,1
not sheer brilliance they were stumbling,1
around and eventually recognizing that,1
something that had been actually almost,1
obvious was there before you in biology,1
I'm not talking about chemistry physics,1
they're quite different subjects but,1
biology is is very complicated you're,1
made by Darwinian evolution you're not,1
actually a logical way of doing what you,1
do you are fit for purpose so it doesn't,1
help to be terribly clever to be,1
absolutely brilliant to do be terribly,1
logical just have to do experiments and,1
observe the results and draw your simple,1
conclusions from those experiments that,1
that's what we do well I someone was,1
Did anyone influence you?,1
very kind to me and the start of all,1
this was to David whether all I had a,1
slightly unusual entry to this I I I'm a,1
physician I trained as a physician and I,1
had this idea to work on erythropoietin,1
which is a little bit unusual that was,1
very important because it's a relatively,1
small field and that I needed someone I,1
needed an institute I needed an,1
infrastructure which actually knew about,1
molecular biology and David Weatherall,1
and also John Bell who had one of the,1
labs in David's Institute very kindly,1
taught me the technology that was,1
necessary for the molecular approach to,1
erythropoietin regulation so there were,1
very important people I did just qualify,1
the the the the word mentor they the the,1
people were helpful were those who built,1
confidence now in some respects a mentor,1
is someone who might guide you to the,1
right field or the right area I don't,1
think that's very good because it,1
almost certainly will guide you to fill,1
this already occupied by others so,1
they're really helpful people are those,1
give you the confidence but allow either,1
completely free choice that was,1
important to me that people were kind to,1
me in that way I think it's a I've had a,1
What would you say to a young person going into science?,1
terrific time in science medicine so I,1
recommend it to anyone really as I said,1
just now the accent is on find your own,1
question you must do that you have to,1
acquire the technical knowledge but the,1
application is yours you own your,1
destiny do your own thing,1
confidently they're often rather,1
unreasonable people you know that you,1
know that reasonable people don't,1
discover the North Pole they don't,1
discover the South Pole they don't cross,1
deserts climb mountains and they don't,1
discover well to a first approximation,1
they don't discover things in science,1
but most of those scientists are in in,1
some way unreasonable people who don't,1
fit the mold and I guess for the young,1
people it's important to support them in,1
their unreasonable behavior someone will,1
always say it's not worth doing it's,1
going to be done by other people that,1
can't be done all sorts of reasons for,1
not doing research there's only are the,1
unreasonable people who really take it,1
on and also since I have an experience,1
in university the management I was head,1
of department for a while heads of,1
department have to know that often the,1
most awkward people in their department,1
are the most productive I feel careful,1
How did you react to finding out you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?,1
I'm there I'm a scientist that's one,1
yeah so we would like to be sure of our,1
facts so I was listening very carefully,1
make sure it really was Thomas Feldman,1
on the telephone before I I was,1
completely convinced of course there was,1
collateral evidence coming quite quickly,1
and in the announcement over the web and,1
and in all sorts of congratulatory notes,1
my friends and others very quickly saw,1
then realized probably true I had in,1
fact got it,1
well oxygens live essentially powers the,1
Can you describe your Nobel Prize-awarded discovery?,1
fuel of metabolism which the cells need,1
to grow to make new molecules you need,1
it for the energy of movement,1
practically everything the body does,1
needs energy and that energy comes from,1
essentially the burning combustion of of,1
oxygen that level of oxygen to support,1
the energy needs but not to cause,1
trouble has to be precisely right so we,1
discovered a system akin to a thermostat,1
for temperature but for oxygen by which,1
the cell sends the level of oxygen and,1
make hundreds or thousands of responses,1
to adjust their metabolism their,1
behavior in many many ways to the level,1
of oxygen or to adjust the level of,1
oxygen to what they need both types of,1
adjustment is the practical use of our,1
What practical uses are there for your discovery?,1
research well I think the researchers,1
we've been very fortunate we didn't,1
anticipate that we would find as the,1
oxygen sensor an enzyme an enzyme is a,1
biological catalyst and these enzymes,1
are often the targets of drugs and this,1
enzyme your oxygen sensing enzyme is a,1
classical drug target and that means,1
that we can alter that thermostat for,1
oxygen with a drug mimic the body's,1
natural response say to low oxygen and,1
improve the adaptation diseases which,1
involve low oxygen and many many,1
diseases have low oxygen hypoxia we call,1
it as a component so anemia for instance,1
can be improved by drugs which mimic,1
hypoxia make the body think it's as less,1
oxygen and move up the level of red,1
blood cell production and those drugs in,1
fact are are undergoing,1
what we call late stage trials in the US,1
and Europe there are actually licensed,1
for the treatment of the anemia,1
complicating kidney disease which is due,1
to low erythropoietin levels in in in,1
Japan and and China of course with all,1
new drugs there are uncertainties and,1
we'll know over the next so many years,1
whether this is a blockbuster cure for,1
all sorts of low-oxygen diseases or,1
whether it's difficult to do that safely,1
and the indications have to be,1
restricted I think there's a good,1
Is there good balance between basic and applied research in medicine today?,1
balance you asked about basic research,1
versus applied research research has to,1
start with the basic facts actually,1
would prefer to call it passion driven,1
research I've heard a lot of terms for,1
this curiosity division driven bottom up,1
basic research I don't think they convey,1
to the average person the reasons why we,1
do this we discover things that's what,1
we like to do we get passionate about,1
doing it and this is an important,1
principle that people work in this way,1
and they find things out that knowledge,1
long as it's secure knowledge other,1
people build on in often quite,1
unexpected ways and and our work was was,1
really unexpected we started to work on,1
erythropoietin we found this general,1
system that was a surprise to our,1
surprise also it was an enzyme that that,1
could be targeted by drugs so those are,1
all examples of passion driven research,1
that turned out to have that utility,1
that song that society is rightly,1
seeking but I'm as you see I'm I'm,1
believe things to begin with that basic,1
principle get the knowledge right and,1
many people can build on it,1
