Where does your passion for science come from?,
foreign,
for science come from,
when I was a kid,
I lived in a small village in France and,
at that time it was very rural so there,
were not so many technical objects but I,
was fascinated by any tool from the,
carpenter for people like that and I,
don't know why but I was really always,
fascinated by,
technical objects and then I was a,
reader of gila Verna julverne is an,
inspiration or more it was,
confirming what we were learning,
remember it was in the 50s and the 60s,
it was after the war and there was the,
idea of progress and there is one book,
of julve little mysterious the,
Mysterious Island where engineers and,
scientists arrive on an isolated island,
and because they have the knowledge of,
Science and Technology they will be able,
to develop a comfortable civilization so,
that was a belief that science is good,
for humankind,
are you still a reader,
Are you still a reader?,
oh yes sir sometime you know for the,
pleasure I go into one of these old,
books,
what made you decide to pursue science,
What made you decide to pursue science?,
ah I think really since elementary,
school I was attracted towards,
scientific between God's things because,
at elementary school it's very simple,
but anyway anytime the the teacher was,
doing a little experiment between God I,
was always interested by that and then I,
went to high school and it turned out,
that at that time for four years in high,
school there was math but and and,
natural science okay live biology but,
there was nothing about physics and,
chemistry for four years and I felt,
frustrated I was waiting for the moment,
when I would learn physics and chemistry,
so I think I was always fascinated by it,
and what happened then in the last year,
of high school I had a fantastic teacher,
at the high school who really determined,
my life because he taught me what is the,
approach of physics that is to say a,
blend between pragmatism,
but also solid mathematical model and at,
each time finding the simplest possible,
model but anyway it must be,
sophisticated enough to render an,
account of of the phenomena and this is,
really a high school teacher who taught,
me that,
When did you know you wanted to pursue quantum mechanics?,
when did you know you wanted to pursue,
well I smile because the story is,
interesting uh I had excellent studies,
excellent courses at University except,
for quantum physics,
seeing it from now clearly it was a very,
bad teaching the the professor did not,
understand what was really quantum,
physics and so I am that frustration I,
knew that it was important and I knew,
that I did not know it well and what,
happened is that a while it was in,
Africa in Cameroon for military service,
okay I was teaching rather than going to,
the Army uh I had the opportunity to buy,
a book by Claude coint energy November,
897 Bernard you and frankly and I,
learned quantum physics into that book,
and then I understood what it was about,
and when I came back to France and found,
the paper by John Bell which determines,
our experiments I was ready to,
appreciate the paper by John Bell,
what does it take to proceed in science,
What does it take to proceed in science without support from others?,
without support from others,
you know when you are teaching,
it's a different world so for me the,
week was cut into part there was the,
part dedicated to,
building that experiment and making,
tests and progressing in the in the,
development of the experiment that I was,
doing and on the other hand there was a,
teaching and teaching is very rewarding,
because if you feel that the students,
understand what you are explaining that,
they are making progress really it makes,
you happy so in fact,
I think the fact that I was teaching was,
crucial for me,
well teachers is very important I mean,
the the fact that we have a future,
scientist depends on teacher and,
Elementary School teacher High School,
teachers,
What advice would you give to a student interested in science?,
what advice would you give to a student,
interested in science well modern early,
my advice would be follow your taste,
don't listen to Fashion because maybe,
nowadays I tell you that this is a,
fashionable subject but five years from,
now it will be another one so I think,
you should really work in what you are,
interested,
it may be basic science it may be,
technology it must be application it,
just depends on the person each person,
is able to know exactly what is is or,
her passion and this is what they should,
follow,
how do you like to spend your free time,
How do you like to spend your free time?,
well what can I say,
it depends on the on the moment in my,
life when I was younger I was spending a,
lot of time in sport hiking playing,
tennis,
Etc when you get old you are not as,
fitted for doing so much sport so what,
do I do cooking cooking I like cooking,
uh I also like,
rehearsing for magic tricks you know,
since I got mandatory retirement okay uh,
I thought I had some free time and I,
started learning to do a magic with,
cards and I'm not an excellent magician,
but anyway I know some classical tricks,
but when I do these tricks rather than,
saying the usual words of a magician I,
pretend that it is quantum and so you,
know when a car jumps from here to my,
hand I say oh this Quantum tunneling,
effect you know so I spent some time,
doing that and of course spending time,
with the family my wife grandchildren,
yeah my children,
Are there any similarities between quantum physics and magic tricks?,
are there any similarities between,
quantum physics and magic tricks,
not at all,
because magic tricks really if you want,
to do well a magic trick it has to,
become automatic like riding a bicycle,
and then you don't your fingers work,
independently of you and then you can,
think about a speech which has nothing,
to do with what you are doing so you can,
pretend that it is quantum physics,
because your fingers work without,
thinking of them,
so it's certainly not like an experiment,
because in an experiment each time you,
turn a knob you have to think about what,
you are doing and observe and react,
What environments help with creativity?,
what environments help with creativity,
I need to have apparatus and knobs to,
turn and so for instance when I cook,
there is something which is very special,
love perfect egg it has to be cooked at,
64 degree celsius not 62 not 66 so I,
like to have a thermometer and to tune,
the the heating Etc,
probably it reminds me of doing an,
experiment adjusting everything in real,
in real time okay observing reacting,
tuning,
Can you tell us about the object that you are donating to the Nobel Prize Museum?,
can you tell us about the object that,
you're donating to the Nobel Prize,
Museum,
the the original,
thing in my experiment is the fact that,
the experiment is about two photons,
traveling to detectors and the idea is,
to change the setting of The detector,
while the photon are traveling and this,
takes only one or two dozens of,
nanoseconds so it has been it has to be,
very fast and you cannot rotate an,
object in a few nanoseconds so my idea,
was to have a switch and the switch,
would send the light either towards a,
first apparatus or towards a second,
apparatus and if the switch was fast,
enough it would be equivalent to a,
single operators rotating from one,
position to the other one Etc,
and this is why my initial idea I had,
published it from the beginning and a,
company that promised to deliver the the,
switch in fact the switch was my idea it,
was based on the interaction of light,
with an acoustic standing wave okay,
and a company had promised to deliver it,
but I wanted it big enough and after,
some time the company said we cannot,
deliver it because so big we cannot we,
cannot make it it's too big and the,
reason was that when they were sticking,
a transducer on a crystal it has to be,
done at high temperature and then,
because a dilation is different between,
the master Arrow it was breaking all the,
time so the problem was a contact,
between the material and the transducer,
and I was despair because I needed that,
okay and I began to think and when you,
are despaired you become creative and,
suddenly I realized that I did not need,
a crystal water turns out to be a good,
material for that and now if I have,
transducers in water no problem of,
different irritation there will be no,
breaking so we built homemade and the,
object I come is real made I mean it's,
it's like you know I don't know how you,
say in French you know it's one thing,
which is not a nice subject but it,
worked,
What about the future of quantum mechanics excites you?,
what about the future of quantum,
mechanics excites you well in fact what,
is exciting in the last say decade or,
decades is the fact that smart people,
discovered that entanglement can be used,
for applications and this is a whole,
world of quantum Technologies and the,
idea that maybe we have a quantum,
computer or Quantum simulator which is,
able to solve problems that we don't,
know how to solve with our usual,
computers I think this is very exciting,
because you know when you have been,
working in fundamental science and,
suddenly somebody comes and say you know,
you pair of entangle photon can be,
useful for something I like this idea,
okay and so this idea of a quantum,
computer I think that they can be,
fantastic we have problems of,
optimization for instance you know now,
we have wind electricity solar,
electricity and the equilibration of the,
electric grid is a very complicated,
problem it's so complicated that you,
cannot find the solution with a standard,
computer because it's called a difficult,
problem a problem,
for which the time of computing,
increases exponentially with a number of,
elements to to adjust,
it may well be that a quantum computer,
can help solve this kind of problem not,
only this one of course no but this kind,
of problem and to be honest I would be,
excited to see that,
Do you ever think about your professional legacy?,
think about your professional Legacy oh,
no,
but I can think about it,
[Music],
I think that,
if there is something,
I would like to teach is curiosity and,
when something interests you just go,
into it and try to understand better and,
better and don't listen to people who,
tell you it's not interesting if you,
find it interesting just continue in it,
What do you think about people saying that you proved Einstein wrong?,
are people saying that you proved,
Einstein wrong,
often people say that my experiment,
showed Einstein wrong and I think is not,
fair at all because what happened is,
that Einstein raised a problem,
and his vision of the world was such,
that he came to the conclusion that one,
must,
complete quantum theory and Niels Bohr,
disagreed with him and the experiments,
we have been doing on test of Bell's,
inequality show that quantum mechanics,
cannot be completed along the lines that,
probably Einstein had in mind so from,
this point of view it's true that it was,
not it was not fully right but he did,
not know about our experiments in his,
time he could think that his,
interpretation was compatible with,
standard physics so we don't know what,
he would have said and moreover I told,
you that the entanglement is a very,
important property who put the finger on,
entanglement and saying ah this is,
really amazing it is Einstein so really,
when people say oh you should understand,
wrong I say come on I showed Stein was,
great,
and if he had known what we have today,
nobody knows what he would have said,
Foreign,
Where do you get your passion for science?,
[Music],
I think my passion for science may be,
something that I had in the blood early,
on because I think I was born very,
curious I always been very curious I'm I,
believe I've always been very creative I,
love to play and doing stuff and always,
very curious about understanding how,
does it work when I was kid I used to,
break apart stuff just to understand how,
it works,
of course I was not able to bring it,
back it was not something very nice,
sometimes for my mother but I think I'm,
born scientist though I'm very curious,
and very math gifted so I went can,
naturally into into physics because,
that's something I feel at ease and,
that's something that was responding to,
my kind of let's say my internal voice,
that maybe that's something I should be,
doing I can never stop asking to myself,
What do you like about science?,
oh why is that what does it work and why,
did we do that and all that and I'm also,
curious about it's not about physics,
only it can be about psychological,
pattern me but the way the society work,
the way the financial system works I,
think I'm very collected and it's the,
kind of a soft madness in a way that I,
always want to answer and obviously I,
very rarely got any answer but I really,
want to answer and that does guess this,
kind of a emotional drive or even maybe,
a bit obsessive drive that brought me to,
science I cannot identify a specific,
Was there a certain person that influenced you growing up?,
person that had a specific influence but,
I have had a lot of people that may have,
played some role well first I have a,
very supportive family so I think this,
is essential I don't think if you are,
just under stress and under threat in,
your family it's not possible to do that,
you have to get a free mind so I can,
really do what I want which is what I,
wanted which actually was certainly a,
good starting point I've had a very,
interesting teacher sometimes because he,
was a 70s new teaching in 70s or new PRA,
PRA theories or they were kind of kind,
of funny teachers or maybe it helped to,
develop some creativity into me,
I cannot really say I have had amazing,
physic teacher but I remember well he,
whirled my mathematic teachers and I,
liked it very much I mean they really,
brought me to mathematics and then I,
went to physics I realized that there,
were a lot of cool topic that I didn't,
know I read a lot of books some of the,
kind of almost public oriented and and,
writers like kal Sagan for example was,
one of them I get very very thrilled by,
this and all this together was a nice,
music to my hair and they all together,
brought me to to become a physicist and,
then working on astrophysics so that's,
What was it like to work with your co-laureate Michel Mayor?,
the interesting aspect of working with,
Michele I think I pick Michelle because,
I think we're very similar in the way we,
operate we're very instinctive we can't,
kind of emotional and maybe we can say,
Michele is not very academic in that,
style so it's all by touch,
it's a bit like dual paintings so I,
cannot say any something specific but,
the the root touch painting that you get,
by working with Michele by getting bits,
bits here I think was amazingly useful,
and still today I mean I just love being,
with Michele I love listening his,
perspective of things he has a kind of,
sometimes awkward perspective and and I,
like it is I mean we I think we all need,
what I call a mentor and inspiration so,
Michele was certainly a mentor to me I,
learned a lot and and he helped me at,
least to develop some skill not directly,
it just by just being with him and maybe,
he's having some kind of discussion,
about something and then they will help,
me to think a different way and to,
develop other skill so I must say I was,
being I've been very fortunate to to be,
working with Michele and I hope the same,
for him because I think discovery was an,
amazing teamwork,
What advice do you give to your students?,
well they well it's always difficult to,
give advice to to students but usually,
the way I interact with my students is I,
try to do what's called a light touch,
supervision switch it means you have,
always to be there when they really feel,
the stress because because we're here,
for really do the net here but but it's,
also up to them to find a way so you can,
you can show the way we can suggest a,
way but very very quickly I try to,
promote this kind of spirit that scare,
artistic spirit I mean truth that they,
try their own way to go through through,
what they're doing and and in a bit a,
provocative way if I try to translate,
that is don't listen to your supervisor,
in a way and do it as you feel of course,
you should not apply that strictly,
speaking but but I think it's part of,
this kind of like church and and that,
helped to develop confidence in yourself,
that you can do something without being,
told that you do it but they also help,
you to listen and to try to grab in the,
couple of advice which is the one that,
fits you the most and I think to me,
that's a perfect interaction you should,
have between a student at the supervisor,
and and I something for sure that all,
student have to understand and they,
should really develop the own,
perspective on things and they should,
not be afraid to build confidence and,
quite often I'm facing with the lack of,
confidence and and the confidence it's a,
matter of our self-respect and also a,
cell build-up and the best way to build,
up confidence they just do the things so,
to do the thing don't listen too much,
your supervisor and listen to your guts,
oh the reason why I love working with,
What do your students teach you?,
students is every day they teach me,
something because well first their brain,
is much more fresh than mine they come,
with a very fresh perspective with some,
what some of the time bring new ideas I,
got too spoiled because I know too much,
which is bad if you want to be creative,
at some point but they come with so much,
energy that is so so wonderful so I just,
just love working with students and,
Katie students I work in team I think,
that makes my day really happy well I,
You received a Nobel Prize for your PhD. How can someone follow in your footsteps?,
was a PhD student that's true but you,
know in all discovery that his um there,
is this a matter of luck it's bit of a,
gamble so we have been lucky we could,
have been scooped other people,
I found this before us we have been,
lucky we work right I think the fact,
that was a PhD students certainly play,
some role because I came up with the,
committee of press perspective and,
another way maybe that mission would,
have done it so this kind of teamwork,
that we had with someone way more,
experience somebody way more energetic,
and maybe Ramona even creative in a way,
was a was a terrific team but there is,
no there is no rule I mean just do what,
you think I mean look when I was doing,
that I never thought about Nobel Prize I,
told one out I was I just thought that,
was I was cool what I was doing because,
I just loved it I was doing something,
new I was pushing the boundary of new,
knowledge and I was great because we,
were doing this work would be exciting,
but what we we were talking and,
discovering and announcing to the world,
but at no point I thought I would build,
a Calle and and I'd have another price,
so so I think it doesn't really matter,
if you're a PhD of your junior scientist,
just do it because you believe you have,
to do it and just have fun when you're,
doing,
oh my day was it was really awful I had,
How did you discover that you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?,
problem with my bike and and I had I had,
to fix my bike and I was late and they,
were starting really on the water foot,
then then it turned completely in the,
other direction after not from the Nobel,
Committee actually the the failed to,
reach me but by the by the PR office of,
Cambridge because I was accomplished,
that called me and and told me after the,
announcement because I was not at all,
looking at that I was in the middle of a,
meeting I was really a Nobel Prize was,
the last of my worries and and they told,
me are you aware that you go to another,
place I first thought it was a joke,
and then I realized it was the 8th of,
October and they say are you sure and I,
was so convinced in the way asked them,
are you here for them and they say oh,
just just watching me need to be,
checking yeah and they come back oh yeah,
yeah that's you we see your face okay I,
say oh my god then I lost track of the,
day they asked me what I would do with,
the prize and and I was so no with his,
bike I I said I'm gonna buy a new bike,
that definitely it's in the plan so I'm,
looking for buying a new bike,
oh this is the difficult questions if,
Is there a Nobel Laureate that has influenced you?,
there is any other past Nobel laureates,
and when you look at the list I mean,
there is so many great figure and so,
many great physicists I cannot identify,
some specific one but there are,
certainly a lot of great names that when,
I was a student in the physics I learned,
the history and I learned what they did,
so so certainly the Nobel laureates is,
certainly a good pool to pick a great,
lot of people but I don't have a clearly,
a specific name to tell you like that,
well I'm still learning what does it,
How does it feel to be a Nobel Laureate?,
mean right now to become a normal or at,
is it seems so extravagant right now,
what is going around this I don't really,
know I just I just saw the first effect,
this seems everybody seems to be,
interested by me and they they all want,
my signature and and and that's what I,
see right now I'm waiting a little bit,
all this to go down because I don't feel,
that very different I'm still the same,
person I don't think my science will be,
very different but certainly I do feel a,
sense of responsibility with this with,
this price and it will take a bit of,
time for me to digest absolutely,
everything what it means and what I can,
do with all this with this price oh I,
What do you do in your free time?,
don't have a lot of free time that's my,
problem so the few time I have left is I,
try to dedicate to my family and to my,
wife and and we love just taking care of,
the house doing gardening and when we,
can traveling a little bit and and I,
save a bit of time to go in the,
mountains because I love to ski so to do,
seeing and we'll be trying to save a bit,
more time to just go to nice place when,
we can just go to the beach just enjoy a,
bit more relaxing time that's really the,
optimizing the few time I have most of,
my time it's absolutely obsessive about,
science that's just a disaster,
well I think people that have an,
Why should young people go into science?,
interest for for questions and and like,
the rational reasoning and and and even,
if you're gifted for for for,
girl thinking and mathematic which is,
not everybody but if you are gifted you,
have to do science because that's where,
you will develop all this gift the best,
you can and and science is essential to,
the society it's everywhere I mean all,
the science and our society we're living,
is the outcome of science your cell,
phone is full of science so so I think,
we need scientist and what we need the,
most is not only scientist when it's,
scientists in the government making,
policies because when you look in the,
parliament music in the government's,
there is an absolute lack of scientist,
compared to the weight of science you,
know in your own society so I really,
encourage people to do science and if at,
some point they decide to become prime,
minister or President or Parliament's,
members they should do it because we,
need these people there to be balanced,
with the society really and please do it,
and please please please if you are a,
woman,
I mean don't feel silence is not for you,
this is all wrong,
I mean science is for everybody we need,
all the right man and we'll need you and,
we missing women right now because we're,
missing certainly a gifted woman for,
science that for some social and family,
pressure they don't go into science,
which is an absolute disaster I think we,
should really join it and try diversity,
on science is essential to the science,
when you look back in the science,
scientist about traveling freedom of,
travel freedom of expressions and,
getting the best people in the world I,
mean there is a limited number of people,
gifted they all are well they all around,
the world and we need to have them if,
we're not if a diversity is not,
represented in to science it means we're,
losing capability we're losing people,
we're losing brain well no we have so,
Do you think there's life out there in our universe? How long will it take to find it?,
many planets that the question of life,
is obvious that's our next step I'm,
absolutely convinced there must be life,
somewhere else because I can't believe,
life is unique in the universe there's,
too many stars too many planet that's,
pretty clear now what is still not very,
well understood is what is the origin of,
life and what you need as ingredients,
life is chemistry so and in a way it's,
kind of chemistry that is turning back,
and because the chemistry that leads to,
something that was evolving and then by,
by itself evolved into something more,
complicated now the question is what you,
need and we definitely can look at this,
in the lab here on earth and we can look,
at this on Mars on Venus and Enceladus,
and this couple of other satellite in,
the solar system when you can look at,
that and then you can try to look on,
other planets the question what exactly,
do you look at is not very clear but it,
is believed that at some point the,
geophysics of a planet should tell you,
something about whether there is life or,
not it's a long way it's a long path,
because we don't even connect exactly,
the origin of life on the on the solar,
system now it's something I'm I'm being,
of start spending more time in quite a,
lot of time I mean I started this,
project couple of years ago because I,
was my main focus when I moved to,
Cambridge trying to establish something,
that a new path here and and they are in,
progress and the interesting part of,
this progress the progress doesn't come,
from only astrophysics it comes by,
combining what the astrophysicists are,
doing with what other people that are,
not really dealing very much with stars,
because the dealing with molecules in,
labs is called molecular biology and,
there has been a lot of progress and the,
origin of life from the biology,
perspective on the molecular biology,
perspective the ingredients the unit,
what is the simplest unique you you and,
how do you how do you build them and,
what is the condition for that and then,
the condition is something that the,
astronomers can provide I'm trying to,
get an idea what is the atmosphere about,
what is the kind of planet we talking,
about do we have a plate tectonics do we,
have magnetic field all this does it,
what is the role of all this to to,
initiate the chemistry to have the,
chemistry right and unless a new field,
really I'm talking about which is at the,
boundary between different field that,
connect different disciplines together,
so this is my next big goal I'm not,
claiming I will find the answer to that,
because it's a big questions but I will,
definitely work on this I'm working on,
that already,
the most obvious element that we missing,
to the gwyllion right now is to find,
another,
like us we have failed why no because we,
have not been able to deploy the right,
equipment to do that we know how to do,
it we just need to implement it so have,
build up an international program of,
that called parenting a lot of,
university in the world with no having a,
wool equipment being built and we will,
dedicate a quest for that kind of object,
with telescopes doing only that and they,
may be other in the future and then we,
have to build up the equipment to,
analyze the atmosphere of these planets,
and there will be a next generation of,
space equipment and people are talking,
about about this so this is really my my,
main activity we're moving right now and,
I'm trying to accrete people young,
people on this and hopefully I mean this,
Nobel Prize will be helpful for that to,
stimulate this these new developments,
I'm I mean people are convinced that,
this is what is coming next but it's,
difficult to implement it because he,
since we're building a new science it,
doesn't really fit in the usual box well,
when you have a usual activity it's easy,
but when you do something really new,
like life questions so there must be,
life somewhere we are going to make,
progress on the origin of life on Earth,
and possibility to find life that could,
be like that life we have an earth or,
all the kind of life other kind of,
chemistry certainly within the next 50,
200 years,
What did you want to be when you were younger?,
[Music],
do you know until I reached university I,
was rather directionless never a rebel,
but rather a dreamer I didn't pay too,
much attention to classes I'm sure I,
annoyed my teachers or to what I would,
want to do after I graduated from high,
school so I I didn't have a direction,
until I reached the University of,
Manitoba there I learned that I love,
physics I'm sure there were signs before,
I reached the University that I loved,
physics for example I do remember as a,
youth I would read anything that was,
before me the cereal boxes I read in one,
of my sis elder sisters school books how,
a compound pendulum works and I still,
remember thinking how wonderful that is,
it was a hint that I liked and I like to,
build models because I like to build,
models I entered the university in,
engineering I enjoyed it I guess I could,
have made my way through life as a,
mediocre engineer but to my eternal,
gratitude a friend who I can name David,
Dale Loveridge since I complained to him,
that they were running out of physics,
courses to take in engineering why don't,
you transfer to physics,
perhaps you know the phrase duh moment,
well that was a duh moment why didn't I,
think of that so I entered physics and,
loved it from the start I owe a lot to,
the faculty and I owe a lot to the,
students too you know a student learns a,
lot from fellow students we don't give,
that enough attention I think nothing I,
like better than to see students arguing,
over how to work a problem so also my,
fellow students introduced me to Allison,
saw us married and off to Princeton,
University as a graduate student,
the faculty member who told me I would,
go to graduate school in physics at,
Princeton,
Kent standing died just a year or so ago,
it was a great pleasure to meet him,
prior to that he had his own,
distinguished career in the structures,
of large biomedical bio biological,
molecules biochemical molecules I'm not,
sure the phrase anyway I love physics,
it's just grabs me and still does well,
What do you enjoy about physics?,
one one way to put it I think is that,
event with the compound pooi the,
compound pulley is that the one in the,
same time rather subtle but yet explicit,
within the framework of the of the game,
and similarly physics is layer upon,
layer of concepts such as a compound,
pulley,
each compound complex each or what am I,
trying to say each element of physics is,
when looked at from afar a compound,
pulley it's a simple concept,
well-defined and subtle but yet direct,
straightforward in many ways and the,
physics is just a hierarchy of such,
things I find that neat I suppose I'm,
also satisfied by the fact that in,
physics you get to settle arguments,
because you can do experiments and you,
can find out whether or not this concept,
makes sense it's also relative to say oh,
biology much simpler and I do treasure,
that simplicity again my impression of a,
biologist is someone who is waiting,
through depths of complications it's,
just so subtle,
whereas in basic physics which is the,
kind I enjoy you can actually start from,
the fundamentals and work your way up,
layer upon layer of compound pulleys,
can't do that with biophysics because,
it's just,
to do complicated I guess I could have,
made my way through life as a,
biophysicist too but I wouldn't have,
been as happy yes I can mention - I've,
Was there a particular person that influenced you?,
already mentioned one Ken standing at,
the University of Manitoba,
you know I reflect back and I don't,
remember him and Vern saying I suggest,
you go to the University of Manitoba,
Princeton for graduate study,
it was rather you will of course go to,
Princeton it set my life without if I,
hadn't gone to Princeton I wouldn't have,
met my second and really top advisor,
professor Robert Henry Dickey Bob -,
everyone who was an inspiration when I,
arrived he has doing gravity physics,
which of course led to cosmology he has,
just the sort of skills that I really,
take a delight in he understands physics,
very well but he understands also how to,
apply it and to be very very much a,
person who likes the combination of,
theory and practice which totally,
grabbed me and still does so Bob Dicke I,
have called for many years by professor,
of continuing education,
he's alas no longer with us but through,
the years he taught me so much not only,
about physics but also don't be messy,
with your physics the one time he would,
get hostile is when you were sloppy in,
your thinking and that certain current,
me of being sloppy,
Can you tell us how you discovered you'd been awarded the Nobel Prize?,
well do you know do you know that in the,
US perhaps around the world there are,
sites in which you can place money,
wagers on events such as who will get,
the Nobel Prize and it has turns out,
that these sites have a pretty good,
record you understand that the more,
money placed on a candidate for the,
Nobel Prize the lower the payoff so my,
University and I think many others keep,
track of the odds on faculty members and,
so for the last two years I've had an,
enigmatic message from our department of,
public relations if you need help we,
will if you need help with publicity we,
will come to your aid no explanation no,
mention of Nobel but at this time of,
year you wonder so I was slightly,
prepared and you know what to be honest,
I think it was a good choice,
yeah I've been riding this wave my,
entire career so that was great you know,
they call that a definite hour here in,
Sweden which may be a very different,
hour at the laureates home so five,
o'clock the call and you know at that,
hour either it's something really bad or,
something really good so I was somewhat,
prepared when I picked up the telephone,
Allison's my first words were oh god the,
university was prepared and they had,
laid on elaborate celebrations through,
the day totally exhausted but still,
oddly rewarding,
Do you have any advice for young scientists?,
well you know there is one piece of,
advice that I keep advising keep,
offering don't judge your career by the,
number of prizes and awards I have so,
many and it's wonderful and the Nobel,
Prize is absolutely spectacular Lee,
wonderful but to get such a prize,
requires not only dedication and,
creativity requires eventualities the,
the the cards must line up just so in,
order to make it appropriate for a,
prize-winning committee to to to,
recommend you don't don't count on those,
eventualities judge your career by how,
well you did at it and of course don't,
be sloppy,
[Music],
Do you have any advice for young people entering science?,
my advice my central advice to a young,
person considering entering science of,
any sort sending Natural Science look,
around discover what really interests,
you it may not be the first thing that,
you notice you may find something mildly,
interesting but if you look a little,
harder you'll find something even better,
don't jump into a particular line of,
research and tell you look around quite,
carefully and discover that which really,
fascinates you if you're fascinated,
you'll do well,
Why do you like teaching?,
you understand that teaching the,
students learn from a good teacher and,
the teacher learns from the students,
also you know there is the comment of,
Samuel Samuel Johnson nothing quite,
concentrates the mind like the prospect,
of being hanged and not quite as serious,
but the prospect of having a student ask,
a question that you haven't anticipated,
is something that makes me very uneasy,
so of course when I teach I prepare and,
I try to think of all of those odd,
little side issues that I've never,
perhaps thought through they happen and,
I learn from that also of course it's so,
lovely to see young people who are,
interested in something so interesting,
that they'll sit here and take notes,
from what I say and of course as I,
emphasized time and again they're,
learning from each other nothing I love,
more than to see a group of students,
arguing over how to work a problem,
so that's rewarding and because I love,
physics you're not surprised to learn I,
enjoy talking about it and so yes I have,
taught both students who are advanced in,
physics who are deeply interested in,
physics and those who take the course as,
a requirement the the last is far by far,
the most difficult how do you persuade,
these people that physics is not simply,
a hurdle to pass so they could get on,
and do something they really want to do,
perhaps medicine how do you convince,
them that this is a fascinating subject,
in part you know I think we have to be,
fatalistic about that some people are,
charmed by a compound pulley and some,
are not perhaps you don't particularly,
care about compound pulleys but they're,
neat and perhaps not neat for you but,
for something they are so I guess I do,
have the seat-of-the-pants feeling,
feeling that different people are,
should four very different activities,
well that's obvious isn't it must be so,
if I my test might be offer them a,
compound pulley do you think that's neat,
or would you rather I would stop talking,
about it so most of the time I have,
taught people who think of compound,
pulley as neat even though they've never,
considered that before by far as I say,
the most difficult is teaching into,
those who are not so sure compound,
pulleys or needs the most depressing,
question is is this going to be on the,
exam the most important qualities of,
What are the most important qualities for being a teacher?,
being a teacher I think surely is the,
enthusiasm for what you're trying to,
teach and perhaps it's equally important,
you should pay attention to the student,
that seems pretty obvious but I suppose,
if you are a teacher who don't in and,
you don't enjoy your job then I think it,
would be good if you found another line,
of work,
if you enjoy your job it means you are,
just loved tries transforming you,
transmitting information to the student,
and you will notice the student either,
understanding what you're saying or not,
and if the latter you you're going to,
try hard to to get the students,
attention that was when we used to have,
hour and a half long lectures to stop,
halfway in between was a good way not,
only to get them awake is its brother,
hard to sit for an hour and a half but,
also I found there are students who have,
questions they don't want to ask them,
because they don't want to be the,
subject of attention and the brakes were,
a wonderful way for a student who is,
diffident to approach me I don't know,
how to encourage his people to speak up,
no one's going to bite them some people,
are just like that and so the brake was,
always a good way not only to refresh,
all of the students but also to give the,
diffident ones the chance to talk to me,
What do you enjoy doing in your free time?,
as I reached the golden years I I find,
that I enjoy physics,
so I don't often take much time off I,
love going into the laboratory and,
writing or calculating or reading I used,
to enjoy gardening quite a lot in recent,
years,
well physical effort is becoming more,
difficult the fact that the market,
garden has helped tomatoes in immense,
abundance when I have my pitiful few,
tomatoes I stopped gardening however,
well I just I spent the last two years,
full-time on a book on how we got from,
where we we're in the past to now in,
cosmology the book is now done it will,
be out next spring I have still some,
deep jobs to do in in checking proofs,
but that the labor is pretty much over,
and I think I will not get myself,
involved in another project that's quite,
that intense and that maybe I will start,
gardening again I think maybe flowers,
rather than vegetables,
Where do you do your best thinking?,
I'm deeply fortunate that we live just,
one mile from my office it's a mile,
through almost entirely quiet,
residential streets so walking to and,
from the lab is to me refreshing and a,
chance to let my mind wander,
I've always went walking paid very,
little attention to where I put my feet,
and so the mind can wander in totally,
random irrelevant silly directions but,
sometimes it will land on a little point,
why didn't I think of this rather a da,
da tried moment though it's interesting,
I discovered a few years ago that I was,
tripping and you know a faceplant when,
you fall it happened to me three times,
in one year no injuries at any time but,
it's such a shock to suddenly find,
yourself prone so I have started looking,
where I put my feet to the detriment of,
my thinking what should I do,
I think I will continue to watch where I,
put my feet I will pay a little more,
attention to that and but I also,
continue to enjoy walking and letting my,
mind wander I hate running,
I can't imagine operating a treadmill or,
pumping pupping weights that sounds so,
dull but to me a walk in the woods or in,
the city is pleasant always is,
oh of course they're in our field we are,
What do we still have to discover?,
leaving we are leaving to the future,
generations a lot of interesting,
research problems the subject do you,
know it's rather difficult to convince,
non scientists of the fact that we at,
the same time have a reliable science,
well-established and yet there are,
simple questions they can ask of you,
that you can't answer it's particularly,
notable in cosmology when you consider,
that we postulate this dark matter we,
postulate this cosmological constant or,
dark energy they surely have deep,
physical meaning that we do not,
understand what a glorious opportunity,
explain this it is it is as I say a,
subtle business to explain that we have,
both great open problems and yet a,
securely established physics the point,
is of course all of our physics is,
approximations we have no complete,
theory in any branch of physics or any,
other natural science we instead have,
approximations that are good or more or,
less well-established depending on the,
evidence we have so much evidence for,
cosmology but I think it's almost a dead,
cert that the dark matter is there we,
know that its properties must be in a,
defined range but that brain is pretty,
broad we're sure that it must be there,
and the great triumph will be to,
identify it lots of experiments going on,
it attempting to do that watch your,
local newspaper,
for announcements,
DONNA STRICKLAND Nobel Prize in Physics 2018,
[Music],
How did you become interested in science?,
if I've been asked that question ever,
been asked the question about how I got,
interesting science quite a bit I think,
it is just my education system it's hard,
to say I mean my dad was an engineer and,
my mother was a high school teacher and,
so I think education was very big for,
both of them so they did take us to,
things like the Toronto Science Center,
and they did take us to these Audubon,
lectures about birds and I have to say I,
did not spark any interest in birds with,
me so I told but not everybody gets,
raised by the parents that are as,
interested in education and and studies,
that way but I think it's mostly because,
in school I did very well in math and,
science and I I was one of those kids,
who thought science class was fun and,
most people don't so I don't know why I,
just did,
[Music],
Did you have a teacher that particularly inspired you?,
I had in high school I think I had very,
good science teachers there was mrs.,
Bowman in grade 9 whose husband was a,
chemistry professor and she would spent,
her summers in her husband's lab,
learning the latest in chemistry so I,
had her for grade 9 science and she,
would like to have things exploding in,
the front of her room and she was,
wonderful in a lot of ways I had her,
again for grade 12 chemistry and she,
brought in chocolate bars for us one,
test B I had to miss because I was in,
the high school band and we'd gone to,
England during the one test and so she,
just she's before you start you must,
have your brain working and so she gave,
us each a chocolate bar to get us a,
brain working but also I must say Jim,
Forsyth was my physics teacher in grade,
13 and I was in his homeroom for the,
entire five years of high school so I,
saw it in the physics room every morning,
to start the school day and he also he,
also has long put me on I'm on I've been,
for 20 years on my high school wall of,
fame and it was my high school physics,
teacher that did that for me,
Did your mother have an interest in science too?,
[Music],
so my mother was raised in a small,
Canadian farm town she was raised on a,
farm she had an older brother and an,
older sister now the brother inherited,
the farm and did not go to university,
but the two girls and and this was back,
in the 1940s were both sent to,
university the oldest one had thought,
about going into medicine but switched,
into nursing and my mother wanted to go,
into maths and Sciences that's what she,
was good at but before her sister went,
ahead of her and my mother got advised,
that as a female she would find going,
into the science it's very hard and that,
she would be better served by going into,
the arts so my mother listened to these,
people because coming from a town of,
"1,000 she just felt overwhelmed about",
the idea and so she chose to go then,
into the arts and then regretted it ever,
asked him so again I was raised by a,
very strong woman who made it clear that,
she wished she had followed her heart,
and soul and not listen to everybody,
else,
"When did you first encounter your fellow female Physics Laureates, Marie Curie and Maria Goeppert Mayer?",
I think Marie Curie is just one of those,
icons that you hear about so I can't,
possibly tell you when I would have,
first heard of her gay purred my I,
didn't even know was a woman when I,
cited her in my thesis I just knew of,
you know,
JP Myers work and it is very funny that,
I actually said he and my thesis that's,
how uneducated I am and one of the,
people reading the theorist who had,
helped me at the end he Joe Everly,
stroked it off and said Donna shame on,
you,
[Music],
How has being a women in science changed over the years?,
I think since Maria gave it Meyer has,
won that there's many more women in,
science then than when she was there,
right I think the fact that she did not,
get a paying job as a scientist until I,
think the 1950s which is when she did,
her Nobel prize-winning work is amazing,
right so I've been paid all along I,
never had a female professor not as an,
undergrad not as a grad student and now,
there are six of us I believe in my,
department of 40 so that's still only,
you know 15% it's it's not as high as it,
should be but the fact that there are,
even six women instead of zero is quite,
a change so I think things are changing,
for women all the time,
certainly I grew up in the 70s and we,
were all about women's lib and I,
remember being told over and over again,
women you can do anything,
so never entered my mind that I couldn't,
[Music],
How can we encourage more women to do science?,
I think everybody in the world should be,
told that do what you love and what you,
think you're good at I don't want to,
really distinguish men from women I,
think there are jobs that are,
stereotypically women jobs and I don't,
see any reason that men shouldn't do,
those I don't think women are more,
caring than men and yet we hear you know,
so many jobs are for women because,
they're the more nurturing I think,
that's just as wrong on the other side,
so I think every person should be,
exposed to every type of field and find,
out what they're good at and everybody,
should get to do what they're they're,
good at on what they love to do,
[Music],
What advice would you give to the younger version of you?,
now you know I feel like I have was born,
under a lucky star and just life just,
worked out for me and then I will tell,
other women who ask me this because the,
people are always wondering you know,
when should you have your children and I,
said no you just do what everything when,
it feels right for you no there is no,
one life plan that works for everybody,
and because my husband and I the first,
year of marriage actually lived,
bicoastal so that we could both have,
good jobs that got old fast and so I did,
give up on on the academic track and I,
took a job as a member of technical,
staff and it turns out that it was,
perfect for me because I had my two,
children I went through my two,
pregnancies on that job and I was,
someone who was not just all nine months,
all day long and I realized that when I,
got the my first teaching job which was,
right after my second child was born I,
thought I could not have lectured,
through those two pregnancies I could,
not have stood in front of a classroom I,
was so well through all those two sets,
of nine months so to me my life just,
keeps working out I thought maybe I was,
giving up on my career but I hadn't and,
someone like the University of Waterloo,
was willing to hire me after four years,
of being out of the academic track and,
so this is what I always tell women that,
you have to do what's right for you at,
the time that's right for you and hope,
that life works out I don't know maybe,
I'm the only one born under such a lucky,
star but my life seems to keep working,
[Music],
How has your career been impacted by being married to another researcher?,
I think this is the toughest thing about,
being a female scientist I think once we,
become 50/50 women and men then it won't,
be quite the same but almost every,
female scientist is married to a male,
scientist male scientists can't be,
married to female scientists there's not,
enough of us to go around for them and,
so it does bring in the two-body problem,
and most couples have to find jobs,
together but many other jobs exist in,
almost every city whereas science jobs,
only come up rarely here there and,
everywhere so if you want to do the type,
of sites you want to do you have to be,
willing to do look worldwide and so it,
is very hard for two scientists to get,
jobs together and I must say my husband,
followed me to Canada and took a job,
with industry and it's not it wouldn't,
have been his choice either and so we,
took our turn as he says he's now been,
22 years living in my country near my,
family and with me doing the job I,
wanted to do and I only was four years,
in New Jersey near his family in his,
country with him doing the job he wanted,
to do so he kind of keeps asking when,
it's his turn for me to go back and,
follow him,
I think diversity is a good thing,
Why is diversity important in science?,
whether you're in science or in anything,
again it goes along with not only should,
i Vijender be exposed every person has,
the right it shouldn't be a privilege it,
is a right to do what you want to do and,
what you are good at and I think and,
I've said this before I think the world,
works best if we all do what we are good,
at so that no group of people should,
ever be discouraged from doing what they,
are good at the world works best if we,
all get our opportunities and we all do,
it,
[Music],
How does it feel to be awarded the Nobel Prize for your very first paper?,
so it is unusual that I am winning Nobel,
Prize for my very first work I you know,
it's not called it a one-hit wonder,
quite a bit at the time when I give,
talks and people always want to hear,
about this one paper rather than my,
newer work it's unusual most of the time,
I think supervisors get the credit for,
the work and I also think that Gerard,
Maru my supervisor deserves more credit,
maybe for this prize than I do because,
it was his idea as the student it's my,
job to take the idea and make it a,
reality and so a lot of work goes into,
that and people over the years have said,
that the students should be credited,
with the fact that although you're given,
one grand idea you still have to figure,
out all the other details to make the,
idea work so everybody should be,
rewarded I think possibly I'm one of the,
people that are getting rewarded as a,
student because it was an individual,
project and so there were just the two,
names on the paper as opposed to a large,
group of names and therefore when it's a,
large group of names one person,
represents that group and it that one,
person would have to be the supervisor,
[Music],
How did you find your time as a PhD student?,
uh I when I went to graduate school I,
really went with the attitude that I,
wanted to do one of the world's best,
PhDs now I didn't think I was unique in,
that I would think every student going,
for PhD must hope to do one of the,
world's great PhDs I don't think anybody,
goes to do a PhD for society to say,
great job I think there's many other,
jobs where your parents are telling you,
be a doctor be a lawyer,
there are things at least in North,
American culture which are held up on a,
pedestal and science isn't one of them I,
think you go in and do a PhD in science,
because you just love it and want to do,
it and if that's why you're doing it you,
must want to do the best so there was,
that there was a sure ARDS group were,
was just a group of fabulous students,
and we were all there trying to do the,
best so I think we all aged each other,
on we all helped each other but there,
was also that competitive spirit in all,
of us and we all kept we all knew the,
other one was working hard so we must,
work hard but as well when anybody,
struggled we all figured out a way,
around each person's struggle so that,
they could keep moving forward so it was,
even though I'm the only one getting,
credited it was quite a team effort,
[Music],
How important is collaboration in science?,
I think that science is a team sport I,
think that you have to talk to somebody,
else about it it helps you form your,
ideas and it also will spark something,
especially if you're at a dead end,
trying to figure it out there has to,
always be this conversation back and,
forth whether it's from student a,
supervisor student a student student,
tent you know to anybody yes from,
science to scientist it just helps to,
talk about what you're doing,
Do you enjoy mentoring students?,
of course it's a fun it's fun to have I,
particularly like having students in my,
group and talking to them and trying to,
get them to see it from their own,
perspective and get them to the point,
where they're telling me the new things,
and that I can learn from them that's,
that's always the goal of every,
supervisor is to bring your student to,
the point where they're letting you know,
what I should already know and so that's,
that's the joy in it,
[Music],
Do you have a favourite piece of advice for students?,
hmm no I don't I don't I don't think I,
have one piece of advice that every to,
give to a student I think each of us is,
unique and each of us sees it from a,
different point of view and so what one,
person needs another person doesn't need,
I will tell you though that quite a long,
time ago,
before I even came to Waterloo there was,
a student who was to give a talk and a,
female student to give a talk and this,
female student was particularly nervous,
and I pointed out that I said this is,
one of the challenges that I think women,
have to overcome is that boys at the,
time certainly were raised to have,
bravado boys are raised to say look what,
I did,
boys whether it's through sports or,
anything they are to stand up and almost,
be beating themselves on a chest saying,
look how good women are raised to say,
quiet and demure and women are raised to,
not show off and I was given this advice,
early on as well I said no you must,
learn that to get your PhD you must be,
able to stand up and give a talk and if,
you're giving a talk about your research,
you are basically saying look at me this,
is what I did now you don't say it in,
those words but this is why it is hard,
or quite often for the females to get up,
and give effective talks because they,
want to always be so humble about it and,
they have to get over that,
[Music],
Is it important for science to be fun?,
so I personally think that since you,
spend so many hours a day at work you,
should if you have the chance I,
unfortunately a lot of people have to,
work just for a paycheck but a scientist,
do not scientists are doing it they,
could do something else that would make,
them more money so I think if you don't,
love what you're doing you're not going,
to be doing it that's all I think and so,
you can call it fun oh you could just,
call that excitement or you can call it,
enjoyable I call it fun,
[Music],
Why do you enjoy science?,
for me the fun of science is that even,
though there's a lot of hard work to get,
an experiment to to happen and that you,
can spend so the one that I'm being,
awarded for took a year of work to get,
done but there is something so exciting,
about Datuk being shown on a screen or a,
laser that you've been trying to,
struggle to make work finally works and,
you see it and laser physics is one that,
you actually see happening there's all,
kinds of things when you see one color,
of light change to another color of,
light or what have you that's exciting,
to see and brand new data that you know,
you have and other people don't have,
this is such an exciting feeling so,
that's why I just I just think it's fun,
and I like building Minaya was one of my,
favorite toys growing up and so building,
lasers falls under that category of,
feeling like a toy and that you're just,
simply playing with a new thing,
[Music],
What application from your discovery are you most proud of?,
well there was only one commercial,
application of this laser yet and that,
is cutting or machining of transparent,
material so it can be glass used on a,
cell phone it can be the cornea of your,
eye that's the one application I was,
actually quite surprised that that,
started just ten years after the laser,
was built usually takes quite a bit,
longer from a research to a little lab,
to become an actual product so I'm,
surprised by that but I think going,
forward the exciting one will be if we,
can actually get laser acceleration to,
work there's a number of people working,
on laser acceleration I myself am NOT at,
this point but I think if we can start,
to either compete with the hospital,
accelerators so that can be used for,
medicine or even the large CERN that,
would be the exciting one I think,
Is it important for scientists to do work that impacts society?,
no I don't feel that the work you do,
should be directly applicable to society,
again it falls under my idea that we,
should all do what we're good at and I,
don't think every one of us is good at,
taking an idea out to there or knowing,
what society should do but again it goes,
back to the fact that scientists have to,
constantly have dialogues and so it's a,
whole train of people and it doesn't,
matter if it's something to be used for,
Society or just an application for,
whatever it's a non-stop continuum of,
people working together so hopefully,
there's other people that are looking at,
this who want to help Society and work,
back to find the right things,
[Music],
How did it feel to discover you had been awarded the Nobel Prize?,
I think it's a shock it's a stunning,
shock to be woken up to be told that you,
are a Nobel Prize winner again this work,
was done over 30 years ago so it's not,
something that I'm living and breathing,
every day that I did pulse amplification,
for my PhD all those years ago so no,
one's expecting in my position to win a,
Nobel Prize so you get woken up at 5:00,
in the morning the my husband is closer,
to our landline phone that is in our,
bedroom and so he answered the phone and,
certainly in the middle of the night,
when you get woken up it's usually a,
fear thing that someone has been hurt,
and so I'm saying what is it what is it,
what is it and that goes they're asking,
for professor Strickland so then you,
kind of know that the no timer might,
called professor Strickland even usually,
at the University so and then you get,
this it's an important call from Sweden,
and then you put on hold although,
actually they hung up on me but I,
thought I was on hold and I'm hanging on,
to Doug going it's from Sweden in his,
October 2nd and I think I won the Nobel,
Prize this can't really be true so,
that's that's all it feels like this,
can't be true,
[Music],
How did your friends and family react?,
so many things my daughter I texted four,
people up before the press conference,
and after I'd received the call like I,
texted my brother and my sister my son,
and my daughter,
I knew that my brother and sister would,
get it right away my sister was in,
Europe so would be the daytime and my,
brother wakes up I knew my two kids,
would not get it right away and the,
funniest one was my daughter who,
unfortunately had her email hacked in,
the summer before this and so when she,
got the text saying I alt said this I,
won the Nobel Prize she goes off mom's,
phone has been hacked and even her,
girlfriend called her and said,
gratulations on the Nobel Prize and she,
goes no my mother whose phone has been,
hacked and she had to be told though,
it's in the news so then she google and,
she was just she was in tears screaming,
at me and the phone call so that was,
exciting I think at my press conference,
at the University the first day my,
entire department showed up and the,
former chair of the department who I was,
associate chair under stood up to,
congratulate me on behalf of all of them,
and he almost had me in tears because,
they were just that's when I really,
looked I think I was a deer caught in,
headlights with so many cameras on me,
I'd never faced such a thing before and,
when I looked at each face there and,
they were just all beaming at me it was,
it was almost too much,
How has the Nobel Prize affected your life so far?,
[Music],
my life got turned upside down with,
winning the Nobel Prize,
I now realize I don't think at the time,
I realized how reclusive I was and how,
much I enjoy spending time all by myself,
until I found out that that was not,
something possible after winning a Nobel,
Prize and that all of a sudden people,
want my autograph or people want to take,
selfies with me or you know and like I,
said everybody in my department now when,
they see me a big smile comes on their,
face and yet it's like really because,
you've known so things are very,
different for me I I kind of hope they,
go back to just a normal way I don't,
think people can live on this heightened,
excitement for very long but it's been,
quite different for the last two months,
[Music],
What qualities are needed to be a successful scientist?,
well for a scientist needs first,
curiosity they need to be excited about,
trying to learn something different they,
have to be able to communicate well to,
be a good scientist because you do have,
to talk back and forth so that you get,
these new ideas I think an experimental,
physicist needs incredible patience and,
so some students try it for a while and,
realize they simply don't have the,
patience to do that kind of work and,
then of course things break and you have,
to start again and this is it can lead,
to a lot of frustration so you have to,
have that kind of patience but again if,
it's work you enjoy it's not as hard as,
it is although it frustration is still,
hard to deal with,
[Music],
How do you deal with scientific challenges?,
I'm somebody who knows what I'm trying,
to get to at the end of my project and,
so it doesn't matter how many hurdles,
get thrown in as soon as that's another,
hurdle one must figure a way around it,
but that is the job of a scientist,
usually the hurdles are a technical,
challenge or a scientific obstacle that,
you weren't expecting but then that's,
what science is about if you already,
knew how everything worked you wouldn't,
have to do the project to start with so,
each one is a new puzzle and you have to,
to me I just think of it as a puzzle,
rather than a problem but then I also,
like to work on projects that not very,
many people are working on rather than,
being part of the race so this is why I,
have not worked on short-pulse an,
application as much I have two systems,
in my lab but I look for projects that I,
find really fun to do but the whole rest,
of the world aren't necessarily doing,
them so I don't ever feel like I'm in a,
time race,
[Music],
Can you explain your Nobel Prize- awarded discovery in 30 seconds?,
in 30 seconds might be very hard this is,
a way to make sure that you can have,
very intense pulses and the idea is like,
I call it a laser hammer in that if you,
can push on a nail with all your might,
it won't go into a piece of wood but if,
you hit it with a hammer quickly it goes,
in and this is the idea is that we can,
make our laser pulses both energetic and,
short but we didn't have the hammer,
inside the laser destroying the laser,
which is why that it never worked before,
but we could we could do it in a way,
that the laser was fine and then make,
the pulse short after amplification so,
that it could be like a laser hammer,
Where does you passion for science come from?,
foreign of a lot of aspects in my childhood and,
education that led me to to the Science World I think initially the main,
the main interest I had at some point in my childhood was to go,
to the university because I could see my oldest sister going to the university we,
have quite some difference of age and I understood that at a rather adult,
age one as a possibility to in a way kind of remain in in the type of school,
and also continue teaching and and do research by asking a lot of,
questions and I was more interested in this approach which for sure is very much Associated,
to science so I think this is maybe the main point and then after the interest to biology,
came came later maybe again a combination of,
of experiences certainly a teacher of biology when I,
was 11 12 years old my staff must have raised my interest in,
in biology to a certain extent because when I joined the pastor Institute as a,
master's student and a I told my mother okay I chose a lab at the pastor,
Institute she told me ah when you were 12 years old you came back around 12 years old you came back from school and,
you said one day I will work at the pastor Institute but she never reminded me this so I think yeah,
and there are some obviously you know different types of experiences that must,
have after conducting me to the world of science and specifically biology,
[Music] know actually why I chose biology at,
Why were you drawn to biology?,
some point again it must have been a gut feeling I was hesitating between,
mathematics and biology and yeah and I decided to go to biology,
I think maybe because I was interested always in in asking a lot of questions or let's,
say I had a lot of questions with regard to to us as human beings confronted to,
diseases confronted to not only physical diseases but also mental diseases so,
I've been always interested in also in everything related to psychology,
Psychiatry and then when you when you start to understand the biological world,
and specifically when you start to understand the microbial world you also understand that the microbes,
work quite much as a you know you find a lot of sociological aspects in the microbial world that are,
quite similar to to our world with you know,
a lot of aspects that are very similar but for sure there are microbes they don't do not have a brain they react,
differently but this idea that they live in a society they have to adapt,
a lot of aspects that are quite much also related and so I saw that in Biology one can nevertheless ask more,
questions that it may be more fruitful with regard to the idea of understanding,
the world and understanding oneself and it's also an experimental world,
and I was also interested in in the fact that it's it's in there is an,
intellectual aspect but there is a methodological and experimental aspect and I was also interested in this so I,
think the combination of everything led me more to biology yeah obviously a biology teacher uh,
Was there a particular person who influenced you?,
certainly that I remember from when I was 11 12 years old I also remember actually a teacher in physics,
and two three years later and this teacher was important because,
from this teacher I remember the the experimental work at the bench that was,
also put forward in a kind of enjoyable way and also working with you know the other,
How do you cope with failure?,
students so understanding that this was not only doing experiments on on you,
know on on its own but also you know communicating with the others,
in the room to to to make the experiment work and that it was also an enjoyable and fun,
experience it was a little bit out of you know listening to a teacher,
stating you know dogmas and facts and I think this was maybe also part of my,
interest in in the experimental science,
so actually doing research is is a lot about dealing,
with frustrations and failures it's really part of being a researcher and if it's actually also part of the,
success of a researcher I believe at least in my case I would not have been successful if I are not,
encountered a number of failures and frustrations and actually it's a Chris bar project in,
my lab really started by certainly dealing with frustrations of of having,
discovered an RNA molecule that is essential for the crispa Castile system that is called Tracer RNA and then when,
we identify this RNA molecule and and we sort of of the certain function of this,
RNA molecule not being able to make a sense of this function and mechanism so it was by you know after two three years,
of frustration specifically from students who are doing the experiments and then the idea to to link this,
molecule to crispr where again you know I had a difficulties to motivate a,
student who are working on on this this molecule to to pursue and and shift,
Direction so she didn't want to to do it and after a year another student said okay I'm going to to do the experiment,
you have to do because you really insist a lot and actually it's also being ready to take you know new ways and think,
differently out of the box and and in the case for crispr was thinking out of the box for the Tresor RNA molecule and,
also thinking out of the box for crispr mentioning that Chris Brown research as,
much as a nobelas awarded the research on on crispar cas9 it also involved a,
lot of pioneers excellent researchers who started to work on crispar that was,
a known started to understand what the crispr system was in bacteria that it was an immune system against,
viruses and other mobile genetic elements starting to understand certain,
mechanisms of crispr and this is you know all this knowledge that allowed me as well to think oh it seems like,
I deal with another type of crispr cast mechanism must be different so it's uh,
it's yeah it's a lot of methodology and yeah it's a lot of failure it's it's,
part of being a researcher experiments uh sometimes and very often fail,
technically so we have to troubleshoot it's a lot of troubleshooting and then in the hypothesis or in the the strategy,
and the methodology of what to do first what to look at it's a process so it's,
always ABC and then plan a plan B plan C plan a one for Chris passes was maybe,
the most strategic uh and effective plans that I elaborated and so it was a,
lot of you know strategy plan a plan B plan C and A1 A2 and you know going,
forward in this direction not being afraid of of failures or otherwise one,
cannot be a researcher as a researcher but I guess it's maybe,
Have you faced any barriers in your career as a scientist?,
for everyone even who's not a researcher One deals with a lot of barriers in in life right specifically during a career,
pass specifically more being a woman I guess I try to not really look too much into,
the fact that I was a woman but rather look into the fact that I am a Scientist,
and and as a scientist you you have to encounter enough barriers already,
um actually as a matter of fact I'm a woman in science but I'm I've also been,
an international scientist so this also let's say triggers maybe,
um more barriers because one has to to deal with uh yeah,
another type of you know culture and another type of environment,
that can be very fruitful but can also lead to some you know difficulties or,
some let's say more time for adaptation there are lots of women in science you,
know this um the topic has,
quite quite dramatically the past you know 30 years we find more and more women,
studying science more and more women let's say 10 years ago 15 years ago,
decided to pursue you know a career in science,
the the system has also facilitated more the access and you know a change of,
culture that would understand that it's very interesting and it's very,
important to maintain diversity or so within the faculty among the the,
professors and the group leaders because this is an enrichment,
um maybe it's not enough the world is still quite masculine,
so um and the decisions are maybe still taken a lot,
by researchers who are you know men I hope it's going to evolve I'm a bit,
concerned with the fact that it has evolved and for the past few years we,
tend to see more young female scientists having,
um let's say not I don't know if it's the courage but it's a deciding to not,
pursue with a group leader position so I hope that this is just a bad timing and,
that there will be more in the future but this is I guess what we observed all,
over the world on other topics and I hope that this will will rise but as a,
researcher one has enough buyers enough and also to mention very importantly and I think this is good you see a change or,
so of culture in also the junior leaders who are men because this is now a new,
generation who wants to to integrate more time for the family and this is not,
any longer a question for female scientists but also for male,
scientists we also are now confronted to the issue that for sure research,
requires a lot of time a lot of commitment and that one has to have it,
compatible with a family life so it's interesting to see that all the problems,
that women had it also become also problems of young male you know group,
leaders which I think is good in a way because it shows an evolution of our society in the right way,
Do you have a message for young female researchers?,
yeah I think a message for the young female researcher will be to,
to not think that you know certain topics in life are are just only for for,
men I think they have access in all days to,
different types of Science and I think the infrastructure as facilitated a lot,
the integration of female scientists and international scientists so I think they should go for it not be,
concerned by fears or or you know a lack of self-confidence,
actually I have worked also a lot with with men and uh often I was surprised to,
know to which extent they were actually like female scientists and they did with,
the same issues they just don't maybe Express them the same way but they deal,
also with frustrations they deal also with sometimes a bit of a lack of,
self-confidence they may tend to maybe express it differently,
or they are for sure raised in in knowing that they have to show their self-confidence and the female they are,
more prone to show you know a certain lack of self-confidence but I think at the end of the day I kind of understood,
that we are all sitting in the same boat it's just the the way to express that may be different and I think it's important to encourage,
the young scientists to understand and the young females who say no we are all the same and and they have to to get,
ways and I think in other days they can be helped or so to be coached and to learn to,
yeah to to deal with maybe certain you know threats that need to be,
improved for being a scientist I think in all days you have also the possibility to have mentors coaches who,
can accompany you know and make the journey a little bit easier and also to,
make the journey in the sense that uh you know to to to to accompany the young,
scientists to to say yes you it's nice you know a path in science and,
not focusfully on the career but just you know to be a scientist and and evolve to then after become a group,
leader not because it's a career but because then after I guess it's also our,
role to to then convey the science to the Next Generation and and you know and,
deal with the group so it's it's not a question of Harry's question maybe of natural path that is you know then you,
grow and and you teach the sounds to other people and you convey the sounds to the younger generation and it's uh,
yeah and it's very nice style of issues like for everything but it's very nice,
What advice would you give to a young researcher?,
yeah so the general advice I give is always to listen to to one sir I think,
it's important to listen to oneself and follow uh the gut feeling follow,
the intuition and in research what is really important,
is to to let's say to to follow what one likes to do so sometimes for sure I was,
also confronted sometimes that you know I liked different topics so it was difficult to choose but I think what,
apps a lot is just to enjoy what you know the science and see um you know,
to see what the science can can really bring so focus on on this and really trigger trust try to trigger,
in oneself the sense of of curiosity of what we like to do and and the joy of of,
the science and this it's important because it allows to deal with the rest,
and and this is what I try to encourage I think science is also uh it's also,
nice it's enjoyable you know so they have to learn to all this aspects to to,
see this aspect and and see that the rest is a little steps that may work not,
work perfectly but that at the end also they make the the beauty of this work that is very typical we are very,
um how do you say a privileged to be able to to ask questions and and work on,
what we like to to work so this is I think is a very privileged situation,
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?,
so to become a scientist you need a number of qualities um,
you need to be to be patient but yet be,
impatient so it's a combination of both you need to be curious I think,
persistent um you need to analyze very well I mean be,
methodologic I think this is important below Jake have the right intuition,
be curious uh yeah know how to deal with frustrations and I have to say that in,
biology it's also work I mean it's I would say it's a little bit mathematic,
the more experience one is doing uh the more results you produce and and and,
the more uh chance you have to to let's,
say to to maybe understand something uh unique so and it's a lot of time with,
oneself to give the time to really think properly read so no acquire the,
knowledge but also enough time to take distance from the knowledge to be able,
to think out of the box and be creative so I think what types as well is to have some activities outside the you know the,
work but still it's a lot of work so I think it's not really something from nine to five because a typical scientist,
will will work a lot but um you know in typical scientists is not,
going to sink at a specific time will think at different times but it's,
really important also to bring some artistic activities or our I will always,
sportive activities because the brain works a lot in the background so one has to to a little bit you know,
have some activities that uses the brain in a different way but in biology it's,
yeah it's a lot of work one has to be very committed [Music],
How important is criticism in research?,
criticizing it's very important in research and it's very important that this that you ask this question,
because um a key or so for success for a researcher,
is to know how to accept criticism it's we are constantly judged and our,
work is constantly criticized by our colleagues and peers,
and we have to deal with it and a good way is to first you know,
self-criticizing oneself like this we can deal more with the critics of the others but it's like this that we go,
forward with our new dogmas and and new findings,
Is it important to have hobbies outside your research?,
uh was studying piano and ballet dance for a very long time until my new,
researches piano I stopped at 14 15 years old that,
started at six seven and I think this was very important for me because I,
think I find in in those artistic activities quite much what we need as a,
scientists it's a lot of repetition a lot of methodology a lot of also,
and how do you say one has to be focused and concentrated and and it's,
also hard on oneself right I mean when you do ballet dance it's not always the easiest I think physical activity,
so I think it's very helpful to also deal with with frustrations and you have creativity and also emotions in there,
which I think you have also in science I always had an interest in,
yeah early on in the literature and then now it's been long years I don't have,
only time to to read the way I would like to read so this it's a little bit problematic with the life I'm I'm having,
or I read articles or you know news but unfortunately less time to read books so,
I hope in the future I can let's say deal with with this frustration but,
otherwise I've always been interested in culture and arts thanks to my parents and I think the ballot dance you know,
it's also quite physical as a matter of fact and I realized recently that actually this was important for me I had,
missed out on having a regular physical activity so I'm doing a lot of sport and,
I think for me it's essential I belong to the people who are more effective while moving and exercising,
uh there are some people that need to be static me I need to move a lot and so I,
think this it's it's it's uh I think people are different but you have a lot of scientists who are actually I know a,
lot of scientists who are very active physically it's very interesting because I believe that,
you know you have different types of scientists those who really need to move a lot to be creative and go go in a,
productive way in their life as a scientist oh,
Describe your relationship with your co-laureate Jennifer Doudna.,
what is very interesting in the crispark topic is that a lot of scientists from different fields actually got interested,
into crispr so you had the pure bacteriologies those who were working on,
viruses of bacteria those working on enzymes those working like me on on you,
know on small RNA molecules and also in the past phages structural biologists,
like Jennifer does a lot of people came together to try to join forces to understand what crispacas was about and,
when we started to work on on Chris podcast 9 we had the first collaboration with an RNA group working on Bacca the,
group of yorkberger with Cynthia Sharma and then a second collaboration with Jennifer delna it was at the time where,
the let's say the project needed more structural biology aspect and so then,
after as typical it is for collaboration you have to meet the collaborators somewhere so we met at the conference,
and I approached her to ask her whether she was interested to to decipher the,
structure of the protein Crystal because she was already working on other types,
of crispaca systems and then you know it's a kind of like I guess for every,
collaboration that it seems as long as we are not forced to collaborate which in general we may be forced to,
collaborate thanks to a funding but we find our collaborators and in general we try to find collaborators we we think we,
will be able to work with because we don't know when we meet the person and as a matter of fact here it was a,
collaboration that was uh that was working well also because the younger scientists effectively doing,
the experiments were also um you know enjoying to work together at,
distance at the time we were using Skype this is important you know you have the people doing the experiments in the,
collaboration it does not work if only the principal investigators think that they can work together effectively the,
work the the scientists doing the experimental workers also to come together and this was the case and even,
though the collaboration was very short it was intense but then after because of,
of the impact of of the work we very very soon actually after we,
published the collaborative work we found ourselves participating in a,
lot of events where we receive you know Awards or other type of of events where,
we were the convey you know the science that,
that we had done and so this meant that uh this meant that we had a lot of of,
opportunities to meet and so um so over the past 10 years we met extra me often,
in different types of events and this was maybe quite peculiar because of the,
real impact of the technology extremifa so we are finding ourselves in a lot of,
of events so that was a very unique I think maybe Story I mean Mia was trained,
as a biochemist and it isist microbiologist but we have the same way of approaching very,
precisely the research and I think this we shared in common also in common the,
fact that you know when you collaborate you have for sure different types of,
scientists and us we are really much maybe because of the type of research that we are doing uh you know we were it,
was very important for us to approach the research in a very precise way and to make sure that you know the research,
will be done and you know really reproducible Etc so it was also important to to work with the scientists,
who has the same view and so this and I have a lot of respect for her as a as a,
scientist [Music] it is interesting as a matter of fact that the crisp podcast technology has,
"What is the ""greatest benefit to humankind"" of your research?",
had an impact on humankind actually quite fast so it's a technology that is,
explained as molecular scissors and that has the ability to edit the genes and,
the expression of genes in multiple cells and organisms in a very precise manner in an unprecedented way in the,
sense that the tool allows to do precise genetics but the tool can be programmed,
and designed in a in a simpler way compared to the tools that were available prior to crispr cas9 and it,
has had very very fast large implications in life sciences globally in biotechnology in medicine and in,
research and development and it has an impact on humankind in the sense that beyond the great,
how do you say applicability of the technology and as a direct medicine because it is now really being developed,
for curing certain types of diseases and we see the first,
cures occurring to treat human blood,
genetic disorders it has also a great impact in understanding the mechanisms,
of Life which for sure contribute to ursulate to you know the,
development of biotechnologies in in general with also you know all the the,
technologies that are used to to produce new types of biofuels or or also,
how do you say request a large number of Technologies including genetic,
technology is for you know genetic engineering and and systems biology and,
so on and so forth there are also great applications in so beyond the research,
and development in the clinical sector and the biotechnology sector there are also great implications in in plant,
biology and the production of plant crops specifically in the world of global,
warming and global global climate change changes the necessity to to be able to,
engineer crops that can sustain the changes that are meant to be encountered,
in the very near future and even long-term future so you know we all I guess in the life,
of today we benefit so much of a great well-being thanks to a number of you,
know Technologies or so um you know Improvement of food and and,
you know and medicine and hairs and and Chris bacas as a great impact in this,
kind that's why it has a really it impacts let's say humankind,
How would you describe the impact of CRISPR/Cas9?,
yes so um very very fast I met certainly,
scientists who were extremely pleased to have this technology that would allow them to to,
do precise genetics in their cells and organisms of Interest which was not,
possible prior to Chris podcast 9. not to such let's say Democratic fashion and,
and you know easy way to design and also at low costs and this I saw it very fast,
and you know what is very interesting is that I still,
for sure meet scientists so now after 10 years I meet scientists who were not,
scientists 10 years ago and who thanked me for having you know given them the,
possibility to start science and to to start projects asking questions they would not have been able to to ask prior,
to 10 years ago I also receive you know,
thanks from scientists to who definitely can also answer questions they could not,
answer and that also allowed them to go to new ways or new new directions in,
their research which they were not anticipating prior to Chris also some scientists who who made their,
their career you know following up on all the developments of the technologies that have been tremendous the past 10,
years with lots of scientists who became also famous themselves because you know they carry you down with the development,
of the technology allowing the technology to be used even further and more precisely in certain subjects,
I never met actually patients who have been cured with Chris Pakistan there is,
a first patient who was cured actually the first patient in Germany,
um and you know for the sake of let's say um you know the privacy of the person I,
did not meet the patient but I think I have to say the the greatest award for me uh was most likely the I mean clearly,
actually is uh the development of the technology after you know seven years uh,
even less into a cure to treat patients because I realized very fast to which,
extent there were a large number of patients in need realized this because you receive requests of patients who are,
quite desperate and quite ready to to try and you know any types of of cure,
they could try to to either for themselves or for specifically kids with,
genetic disorders so very alarming requests and it's here that one realizes,
the power of the technology and resource the fact that this was,
let's say a primary main application that I was wishing for the technologies,
that had anticipated that you know it would be useful to treat human genetic disorder so I'm personally very happy to,
see it happening but again it's it's here beyond the fundamentals and this is,
extremely important beyond the fundamental science there is the development of the,
technology into applications and this is also Associated to the reason why Alfred,
Nobel created these crisis is is really the applications and we never sank enough,
uh all the people who are developing and and you know have to be very much,
entrepreneurial to develop further into applications the the basic science,
and and I think this was a message of Alfred Nobel so we often forget about,
those who who are also doing science and and bring the technology forward for,
good purposes and I think they should also be sent and in the case of crispal it's about uh yeah clinicians developers,
who do a fantastic job foreign,
Official interview with Carolyn Bertozzi,

Where does your passion for science come from?,
for science come from well I was born in Boston Massachusetts in the United,
States and I grew up in a household where,
science was very much a centerpiece and that's because my father was a professor,
of physics at MIT so he had three daughters and it was,
important to him that we would be exposed to science,
and that we paid attention to our science classes when we were children and at no point do I remember being told,
that I must be a scientist but it was absolutely encouraged in our house as,
for my choice of chemistry as a specialty that did not really come to me,
until I was in college and before that I wasn't really fixed on science I think,
I paid attention to the science courses because again in my family there was an emphasis on that but I had a lot of,
different interests and I thought I might be a musician you know as a career at some point,
um and it wasn't really until I was in college when I thought about biology as,
a major and I thought about being a pre-med student you know and go to,
medical school after graduation and so on but um I didn't give much thought to chemistry until I took a course in,
organic chemistry and that was in my sophomore year of college and that chemistry just changed my life,
and I just fell in love with the subject and I'll just never forget what it felt,
like to find a subject that I felt very passionate about and I wanted to learn,
more and I wanted to study not because I cared about my grades at all it was just because I really loved the subject,
Was there a particular person who influenced you?,
was there a particular person who influenced you I have had a few influential teachers and mentors over,
the years I would say the first important science role model I had was my high school,
biology teacher and her name was Margaret Schwartz she's no longer with,
us but she really turned me on to the field of biology,
and then I would say the second important Mentor was my organic,
chemistry professor that was David Evans at Harvard University who just passed,
away about less than two years ago I think um and and those two people really,
brought the subjects of biology and chemistry to life for me and it's,
probably no accident that my own research career has been marked by the interface of chemistry and biology,
What do you enjoy about science?,
you enjoy about science well one of the elements of organic chemistry that,
hooked me on that subject was how visual the subject is,
so understanding organic chemistry is all about understanding the structures of molecules their shapes how they,
interact with each other and I'm a visual thinker so for me you know being,
able to understand a science discipline through vision was I think quite,
profound and it's not hard to stay interested and curious in a field like organic,
chemistry especially in the way that it intersects with Biology,
because there's so much we don't know about biology about the natural world,
including our own human bodies that we occupy every day there's so much we,
don't understand about how our bodies work and when things go wrong in our,
bodies like what what is wrong at the molecular scale so we walk around every day in one of,
the great mysteries of life on the planet Earth so there's always unanswered questions,
and puzzles to solve and chemistry is a very powerful tool for doing that,
How do you cope with failure?,
do you cope with failure well I think a career in science inevitably teaches someone how to cope,
with failure this is you know science is it's like all of the,
regular problems of Life get Amplified in science because,
you're inherently trying to understand the unknown and you have hypotheses that often turn,
out Incorrect and the only way that you can find the truth is to do experiments and trying to understand the data and,
sometimes the data are not what you anticipated so failure is a funny term because we use,
failure to describe events in life which sometimes it's not really a failure if,
you think about it at a higher level for example when my students come to me and they say oh I tried this experiment and,
it failed and I'll say well what why why do you think it failed did you do a bad,
experiment no it was a thoughtful good experiment so why did it fail and they'll say well because I wanted this,
to happen but instead this happened and then I'll remind them that's not really a failure that's just an,
unexpected outcome from an experiment that means you you thought you understood what the outcome should be,
but in fact it was different that means that you have to rethink your hypothesis,
and you've learned something from that quote failure unquote so with that,
backdrop I've certainly had events in my life that at the time I felt were obstacles,
even failures but in retrospect they were learning experiences and one of,
those was during my PhD years as a graduate student when my thesis advisor who was a young,
assistant professor at Berkeley at the time unexpectedly was diagnosed with colon cancer and when,
I say unexpectedly it's because he was only 33 years old it's just the last thing a person expects at that age,
and so to deal with this illness he ended up leaving his position and his,
graduate students such as myself and a few other folks were on our own to,
finish our graduate work unsupervised in the moment this felt like a pretty,
big Challenge and also quite risky in retrospect I learned how to run my,
own research project I learned how to serve as a mentor to the other students,
in the lab who are younger than I was and I just learned how to basically,
manage a research lab this turned out to be a wonderful experience later when I started my own,
lab as a professor but at the time I was a graduate student it did not really,
feel like an opportunity it just felt like a crisis as a woman in science and a member of,
"As a woman in science and a member of the LGBTQ+ community, what barriers have you faced?",
the lgbtq plus Community what barriers have you faced people often ask me if as,
a woman in science or as an lgbtq person in science whether I've faced adversity,
specific to those categories and it's hard to know as an individual,
what you know types of you know adversarial events I might have,
encountered because you never can really do the control experiment right so I don't know what my experience would have,
been had I been male or had I not been a queer person,
I can say that um being a minoritized person in science,
has its challenges regardless of the minority group when I was a student,
there were people who were actively hostile to women in chemistry in particular,
organic chemistry also has a historical culture that was not particularly,
welcoming of women and when I was a PhD student women were,
a minority maybe one out of ten graduate students in my program was female I was,
the only woman in my lab most women were the only woman in their labs and,
I I noticed actually that it was it was challenging for these women because,
the men in our Labs often looked at the women as dating prospects,
and the interesting thing is the men did not look at me as a dating Prospect because I'm a gay person and,
um I I found actually that that was of of benefit to me,
because the men didn't really know how to talk to me and think about me,
um and so without any better idea they just interacted with me like a chemist,
or like a scientist so in fact I think that was a benefit whereas the women that they might have,
thought of as a dating Prospect was less likely to be thought of as a scientist first and foremost,
so it might have actually been an advantage for me you know since I was already minoritized as a woman to,
actually be a gay woman I don't know for sure it's just a hypothesis,
Why is diversity of all kinds important in science?,
why is diversity of all kinds important in science diversity is important in any setting,
where people need to solve complex problems and where people need to think,
creatively so chemistry is a very creative Endeavor,
it's very important that we have diverse voices mindsets people with different,
ways of approaching problems around the table when we're trying to solve these,
important scientific problems there's social science that's been done,
to quantify these benefits and so that's wonderful but it really seems common sense that you,
would want to have as many different voices and as many different opinions as possible when you're trying to solve a problem,
so I've benefited in my own research from having a diverse lab of co-workers,
right from the outset of my independent career I've had very good gender balance,
in my lab and I've worked to recruit people from other underrepresented groups people who,
might have historically been excluded from The Sciences in the United States this might be,
people of color also people who are gay identifying or queer identifying,
um and my lab has always been known as a welcoming place for folks who might,
think of themselves as being kind of minoritized and I always thought that this was my not so,
hidden superpower and people have asked me many times over the years you know what was what was the,
recipe for Success you know for you in your lab and and it was very simple it was diversity,
and now I think being recognized with a Nobel Prize is the best validation I,
could ever have to reflect on the power of that diversity how can you create an open and,
How can you create an open and accepting work environment?,
accepting work environment it's actually not hard to create a work environment,
that's welcoming to a diverse group of people,
um it takes attention and it takes good listening skills,
and communication is very important because you're bringing people together who might not have had experience,
communicating with one another before so just making it clear from the outset,
that this is a guiding philosophy of my lab people who work in my lab have to,
understand that these are my values and these are the values of our lab,
and then when friction arises which inevitably it does when you have,
different people working together there will always be some friction but that friction can be translated into creative,
energy and it's a matter of fostering open communication being a very open,
person myself making it clear to people in my lab that it's a safe environment for them to communicate with me even if,
they're communicating things that are difficult for me to hear being willing to accept criticism in a,
constructive way and these are skills that I think people should develop anyways just to be,
successful productive people in the world and impactful people and it can start in my lab but um,
it's been a process for me opening up my lab in a way that makes people feel welcome to come in even if,
no one else looks like them and I think there's always room for improvement and I've gotten better at it,
over the years and I'm sure I'll continue to improve but it's been very worthwhile and rewarding,
how can we encourage more diversity in science well um I don't know that I'm more qualified,
How can we encourage more diversity in science?,
than anyone else to give this kind of advice when it comes to you know promoting participation in,
science but um I do think it's wonderful for younger children school children for,
example to be able to see scientists who look like them,
I think representation is very important in how we envision the possibilities for,
ourselves so for a young person to see women who,
are successful scientists for a person who is coming into their own,
gender identity or identity around their sexual orientation I think it's also,
very helpful to be able to see Role Models especially since those people are stigmatized in many geographies less so,
in the United States than you know when I was born 56 years ago but but still,
you know that's a that's an identity that comes with a lot of risk in different geographies and so just to be,
able to see a person who's comfortable in their own skin and has found a way to lead a successful,
and fulfilling life I think this could be really profound and then just existing as a scientist is,
not enough for me I think it's also important to be able to reach out,
and to communicate with people you know who are younger and thinking about their future,
and then to demystify what it means to be a scientist I think if you look at the public images,
of scientists whether it's in Hollywood films or television,
scientists are often painted as extreme personalities and usually male,
personalities who are just different from the rest of us either smarter than the rest of us or,
weirder than the rest of us or both and the truth of course is that,
scientists out they are the rest of us and there's nothing really different about a,
scientist from a non-scientist other than a choice they made about their career you know but,
otherwise I think it's great if regular scientists that are not in the,
movies not characters on TV real people cans take the time to get to know,
people who might have a misconception about a scientist I've noticed that,
things that I say seem now to have more gravity even though they haven't changed,
at all you know I've always said the same things but for example,
the day after the Nobel Prize announcement my University had a an event,
and they wanted me to get up and say a few words about the prize and so I did it was very spontaneous I didn't script,
this at all and someone had a cell phone video recording and and they posted a clip on,
Twitter and it was about a one minute clip where I talked about the diversity of my lab,
and how that diversity created a culture in which we felt liberated to think,
outside the box and try crazy things and that tweet just went viral I mean,
they were like you know thousands and thousands of likes and retweets and so on comments,
and I realized when I read the comments on that tweet and it wasn't my tweet it was a tweet from the person who took the video and I was reading through the,
comments and I realized that there was an appetite out there,
for someone to say these words and lots of people have said words just like this and I have said words like,
this myself for decades I've been saying the same thing but now I'm a Nobel Laureate so it just,
gave so much more of credibility to the idea and and watching that tweet and,
watching the comments from that tweet really it really sunk in that it's a platform,
you know when you have a Nobel Prize what advice would you give to young women or people of minority backgrounds,
What advice would you give to young women or to people of minority backgrounds?,
well for people who don't see themselves represented in mainstream science and so that would be women and also people from,
underrepresented Minority backgrounds for those folks first of all I will say,
when I was young I did not see myself represented I did not see,
women successful women scientists who were decades older than me there just weren't enough for me to find them,
and I certainly had no view of openly gay people as scientists or in any,
career really because I came of age at a time when there was so much risk involved in being,
out that people stayed in the closet so I know what it feels like to feel,
like you could never belong in a place and then what happened was,
a few people here and there open the doors for me and I had the great benefit of being,
born into a family where science was encouraged and so I didn't grow up,
thinking I couldn't be a scientist it was only later that I worried about whether I would find my way,
so for a young person who's trying to figure out how they would pursue this career path even though not many people,
look like them I will say first of all now that we live in a globally connected,
world where people can get on the internet and find information they couldn't have found in their backyard,
you can find the role models you're looking for they are out there you just might have to look a little harder than,
the room you walk into so take the time to look online and do,
your research and find out who are the scientists that remind you of yourself I I they're definitely there,
first of all second of all find your Advocates so somewhere along the way all of us had a handful of,
people who stood up for us and if you can find a few of those,
people they might be family members they might be school teachers maybe a neighbor even,
or maybe someone they meet at an event sponsored by the Nobel Foundation,
right if you can find just a few people that can really help your confidence I,
think and then finally as hard as it might feel to break into,
an environment where you feel you don't belong there will be a chance for you to pay it,
forward and you might not find a lot of people in your own generation but if you pay it,
forward there'll be a next Generation that follows you that will be larger more robust and more energized and it's,
worth it I think to stick to your dream even if it means you're more paying it,
forward than paying it back what advice would you give to a student,
What advice would you give to a student or young researcher?,
or young researcher the one piece of advice I would prioritize for a young,
up-and-coming researcher would be um,
I would want to share with them how a life in science is incredibly,
rewarding it's rewarding because it's creative,
so you're you're discovering knowledge and gifting that to humanity for all of,
posterity because once you learn something no one can take that away right it's not an object it's an,
intellectual currency that will be shared throughout the generations,
and you created that right and it has a permanence that ironically a physical object doesn't,
have you can paint a painting eventually it will fade right but knowledge doesn't,
fade knowledge stays with us forever and it becomes the foundation for the Next Generation so that's really exciting,
that alone I think makes it worth it to become a scientist but then on top of that you have a lot of autonomy,
and that's something I have always valued just the idea that I can govern my own,
activities that I can pursue my own ideas and my own interests and there's boundary conditions around it of course,
because someone has to pay for it and I have to convince them to pay for it and so on but I have so much autonomy in,
what I do with science very few professions offer that kind of,
autonomy that's another great benefit of science what qualities do you need to be a successful scientist the most,
What qualities do you need to be a successful scientist?,
important quality of a successful scientist based on the people I've known is resilience,
so that's the quality where you might be frustrated you might feel like you just lost the,
game but you dust yourself off you get back up there and you go out the next day and,
try again and science requires a lot of trial and,
error and there's a lot of confusion and frustration but then you win a few,
and when you actually have Clarity on the science that you're studying,
when you feel you understand it and it works as you had anticipated nothing is,
more rewarding than that do you enjoy teaching I've always had,
Do you enjoy teaching?,
a strong affinity for teaching I discovered that actually during my,
undergraduate days when as a senior I served as a teaching assistant for the,
introductory organic chemistry class and what was so fun about that was I got to,
teach the students who were basically the equivalents of myself when I,
discovered my passion for the subject and I remember how it felt when I took the class and how I fell in love with it,
and when I taught that class A few years later I wanted to create that magic for,
my students and you know every once in a while a student that I was teaching would have,
the same experience that I remember having and they would come up to me after class and say,
you know I'm a pre-med or a biology major but I had no idea organic chemistry was so fascinating I want to,
switch my major I want to become an organic chemist and I thought yeah you know I I recognize that feeling,
and so even now you know and I've been teaching for 30 years or so but I still,
teach that introductory organic chemistry class from time to time and every time I,
teach that class I try to bring back the magic that I remember when I took the,
class from Professor Evans at Harvard so that's part of the fun of teaching is,
just reliving the magic you know and then of course the students even the students that,
don't embrace the subject as a calling the way I did I know in my heart that I have given,
them a foundation that will help them with whatever they try to do next whether it's medicine or science or,
something totally outside I still think having you know taken on,
the challenge of organic chemistry and Having learned what many people feel is,
a difficult subject I think is really enhancing for them intellectually when,
you teach a class you you always learn something even if it's a very rudimentary Class A very you know,
introductory level class I always learn something new when I'm teaching I'm,
preparing the lectures and I'm trying to find real world examples of of that,
topic and then I'm reading the news and learning some interesting recent story that I wouldn't have necessarily,
bothered to pay attention to otherwise but I actually have a very specific story about teaching which relates to,
the Nobel Prize which is um at the time that we were,
trying to develop a new bio orthogonal reaction and we were trying to figure out how to,
get azides and alkynes to react with each other with very fast kinetics,
and the other Nobel laureates who share the prize with me were able to accomplish that with a copper catalyst,
but for our applications for Bio orthogonal chemistry that was not going to be useful because,
the copper catalyst was toxic to cells and we were trying to do chemistry in cells and in animals,
so we needed an alternative and I was teaching organic chemistry that semester,
and I was working on a lecture for the next day which was on the subject of ring strain and ring strain is a very,
foundational Concept in organic chemistry that I had taught about every year for decades,
but until that moment it had not occurred to me that ring strain was a concept we could use to get this,
bioorthogonal reaction to work and it all kind of came together when I was writing that lecture and so the next,
day I taught my class I gave that lecture and then I talked to my grad students and said go see if ring strain,
will solve this problem and it did what are your interests outside of science I've always loved music my parents my,
What are your interests outside of science?,
mother signed myself and my sisters up for piano lessons when we were you know six years old or something so I played,
the piano all through childhood and then in high school I had an amazing music,
teacher named Sandy Peasley in Lexington High School and she introduced me to Jazz,
which was amazing because it's that's a very creative form of music,
so I played in jazz bands throughout High School and on the side I would play rock and,
roll and pop music Just For Fun by myself but when I went to college I got,
involved in a freshman band I met a drummer who lived in the same dorm and we started this band and we,
weren't very good but one of our gigs was at a local college party,
and another Harvard student was there and he heard our band play,
and he was starting his own band and he was an amazing musician and,
I mean who this person is Tom Morello and Tom was two years ahead of me in,
college and he recruited me to join his band and the name of our band was Board of,
Education b-o-r-e-d we thought that was quite clever at the time,
and we played that year in this band and we won the Battle of the Bands and we,
played some of his original compositions people will recognize Tom Morello's name,
because he went on to become a very famous rock musician he formed a band,
called Rage Against the Machine which was an award-winning heavy metal band and then later he formed a second band,
called Audioslave and right now he still performs with rage they they think they're back,
together touring and he also does solo unplugged recordings and he plays with,
other bands he's very famous very well known and at the time I think you could have,
predicted it because he was a phenomenal musician even when he was just 19 years old I still play the piano by myself with my,
headset on late at night as a relaxation activity,
um from time to time I wonder whether I could convince some other professors to get together and form a band with me,
because there's actually a lot of musical Talent in the academic science world,
and in my own department at Stanford we have a drummer and a bass player and,
a guitar player so Nothing Stops us other than time,
How else do you like to spend your free time?,
what else do you like to spend your free time I don't have a lot of free time but um I do try to make an effort to go to,
the gym I'm an avid weightlifter and I've taught myself basketball during,
covid because that was an outdoor sport you know when all the fitness centers were closed,
so I try to shoot hoops a couple times a week if I can but any sport with a ball,
I will try and probably have fun doing how did you find out about the Nobel,
How did you find out about the Nobel Prize?,
Prize well the chair of the chemistry committee called me and woke me up and,
so I found out you know at 1 43 a.m I took a screenshot from my cell phone because I couldn't believe it I said I'm,
going to take a screenshot and then I'm going to wait 10 minutes and then see if it's still there and it was,
so I found out the way that everybody finds out with crazy phone calls in the middle of the night and then,
um then there was the live stream which I watched online and was on standby on the,
phone and then the doorbell rang and it was the media relations people from Stanford,
University were just ready to go came into my place and set up shop and,
arranged interviews for the next 12 straight hours pretty much so that was a pretty crazy few days,
What do you believe is the greatest benefit to humankind of your research?,
what do you believe is the greatest benefit to humankind of your research,
well my research has recognized by the Nobel Prize was,
the invention of a field of chemistry that we call bio orthogonal chemistry,
and we developed that chemistry so that,
a person could do a chemical reaction inside a biological system,
and by that I mean chemical reactions in living cells or living animals or even,
living humans and right now the most,
obvious benefit to humanity is in the form of new medicines and new,
ways of treating cancer and so bioorthogonal chemistry has allowed people to build new kinds of,
pharmacological agents new kinds of drugs that would be hard to build otherwise,
and right now there is a human clinical trial in which bioorthogonal chemistry,
is being performed inside the body of cancer patients in order to deliver a,
medicine to the cancer and spare the healthy tissues so I think in the field,
of medicine is where the biggest impact is right now being felt how does it feel to see your work having,
How does it feel to see your work having an impact?,
an impact I'm delighted to see the work that came from my lab making the,
translation into new treatments for human disease this was the dream of mine you know from,
my early days as a new professor was to do something you know using my,
skills in organic chemistry that might benefit human health at some point,
I didn't know whether that benefit would ever occur in my lifetime a scientist,
rarely knows that but now I I've been working in this field long enough that I can see the,
possible new medicines that are coming from by orthogonal chemistry and I'm just delighted,
Intro,
[Music],
I grew up in Logan Utah which is high in,
the Rocky Mountains altitude nearly,
"nearly 2,000 meters we had deep snow",
when I was growing up and so obviously,
and before I was eight years old I,
wanted to be a driver of a snow plow,
because you could push the snow to such,
great heights but then when I was eight,
my mother took me to a lecture about,
astronomy about the solar system and I,
became very excited about the idea of,
the solar system so she did some,
projects with me about astronomy and I,
started doing reading on my own decided,
I wanted to be an astronomer but then,
when I was 13 I found in the big city,
Salt Lake City great big city came about,
a hundred thousand at the time I found a,
little paperback book called one two,
three infinity by a physicist,
cosmologist named George Gamow and it,
described ideas for mathematics and,
theoretical physics and cosmology and I,
found even more exciting than astronomy,
and so at age 13 I decided I wanted to,
be a physicist but I would work on,
things connected to astronomy and so,
Here I am,
What is the most enjoyable part of science,
the most enjoyable part of science is,
doing it it's sometimes very hard,
sometimes very frustrating but extremely,
rewarding when you suddenly understand,
something it's an adrenaline rush when,
you suddenly understand something it,
doesn't matter very much whether,
somebody else is understood at first or,
not it's nice if you're the first person,
but but just to suddenly understand a,
puzzle that you've been struggling with,
for a long time is just fabulous and it,
is remarkable that we as humans are,
capable of understanding the physical,
world around us in such detail that we,
can predict things that turn out to be,
true that we can understand things that,
are very far from Earth such as the,
black holes that we have discovered,
colliding with gravitational waves and,
that we can use the understanding we,
develop in the physical laws for,
technology for human benefit and so that,
aspect of it also is really quite,
wonderful the power of science for,
understanding and for technology but,
personally the joy of discovery is the,
big deal,
[Music],
How do you validate discoveries,
imagination and creativity are really,
very crucial for particularly for the,
big leaps of understanding but they are,
far from enough because you may have,
imagination and creativity and suddenly,
think you understand something far,
beyond the frontiers of current,
knowledge but you will usually be wrong,
and you validate this through experiment,
and you validate it also by seeing how,
it fits into the well-established laws,
of nature and how it fits logically into,
this complex structure of all the,
well-established laws of nature and so,
you really in order to validate the,
insights you have to use these two,
additional things experiment and,
detailed mathematical analysis,
there are a number of people that have,
influenced me and how I think and work,
as a physicist John Wheeler who is my,
PhD mentor and was a tremendous,
inspiration we had very different views,
about the political world but we were,
very much of the same mind about how you,
understand nature and I learned so much,
from him he was a professor at Princeton,
also at Princeton was Robert Dickey who,
is a superb experimental physicist who,
was a mentor to Ray Weiss my colleague,
,
studying about black holes with John,
Wheeler and gravitational waves and also,
participating in the research group,
meetings of Robert Dicke and I was,
learning about how experimental physics,
is done through Robert Dicke and his,
research group and Ray Weiss so they,
those two were among the handful of,
people who profoundly influenced me,
Who inspired you,
well among the low bail laureates my,
colleagues that with whom I am receiving,
this prize no we actually Barry bearish,
and Ray Weiss and I are icons for a very,
large experimental team of a thousand,
people in LIGO and that team is so,
superb but the people that really have,
inspired me working with him are Weiss,
and bearish and Ronald Reaper who is no,
longer with us has passed away who I,
have worked with intensely on this also,
Robbie vote who was the first director,
of LIGO and helped us in the first step,
in the transition from a set of ideas,
into the real world of a like arrested,
Describe your personality,
[Music],
let me describe my own personal my,
personality I'm a person who likes to,
work on science quietly by myself are,
with one or two students maybe a,
postdoctoral student I'm introverted I,
behaved like an extrovert I learned how,
to do that but I'm fundamentally an,
introvert and I get the greatest,
pleasure from that kind of work but LIGO,
could only be done as a big,
collaboration there was no other way to,
do it and so I gritted my teeth and I,
plunged into this and helped in every,
way that I possibly could to lay,
foundations for LIGO and then to help,
bury barish wherever he needed any help,
from me,
Grohl I go from small experimental,
project that I begin with with Ronald,
Reaper at Caltech and and Ray Weiss at,
MIT a small collaboration into what it,
is today it could only be done as a big,
collaboration it is so difficult the,
things that go wrong are such a huge,
number of different things it requires,
large numbers of experts and variety of,
different pieces of physics and,
engineering to pull it off and LIGO is,
the triumph of a thousand people the,
superb experimental team and I think my,
biggest contribution was to understand,
where they had to go because I'm a,
theorist night and I knew about how,
strong the waves were I understand how,
they interact with the detector I,
understood what needed to be done,
there's no way I could do any of that,
but I could also convey to the funding,
agencies and the science community my,
faith in the experimental team and I,
could explain why I had faith in the,
experimental team and so I that was,
probably my biggest contribution was was,
to convince funding agency and,
physicists that this should go forward,
it's a strange kind of a role but but I,
think without that role it would,
probably not have,
How did you get involved in the project,
for a project of this sort the only way,
it could be done was through a,
governmental agency it was a project,
that cost up until now about 1.1 billion,
dollars it's a lot of money not as much,
as some of the very biggest physics,
projects but by far the I think the,
largest thing that the National Science,
Foundation in the US has ever done it,
was absolutely crucial and so this,
really was a collaboration initially,
between Caltech led by Ronald Reaver and,
me MIT led by Rainer Weiss and the,
National Science Foundation where the,
key person was Richard Isaacson who was,
our program director who himself had,
made an enormous breakthrough in the,
theory of gravitational waves had solved,
a problem that had puzzled everybody,
from Einstein on for decades how is,
energy carrying by gravitational waves,
this was Isaacson who turned into a,
government funding agent and he,
understood how things worked in,
Washington he understood what we were,
doing because he is such a superb,
physicist himself it was he was read the,
the additional person that pulled this,
off,
and without NSF and Isaacson this would,
never never have happened,
[Music],
What kind of team is optimal,
you need to work on my breakthrough,
problem with whatever kind of team is,
optimal and in many areas of physics a,
very small team is optimal that's true,
particularly in condensed matter physics,
it was true on this year's chemistry,
Nobel Prize which was done by physicists,
it is true in last year's physics Nobel,
Prize and so I would say the majority of,
breakthrough work can still be done in,
small teams but there are certain things,
and gravitational waves is one that can,
only be done in a big collaboration we,
in the physics community have learned I,
think how to function side by side as,
colleagues with some people working in,
huge teams like LIGO a thousand people,
and others who are working in the manner,
that I prefer to work myself in a very,
small effort with just one or two or,
three professors and a small number of,
students and postdoctoral students and,
both are needed depending on the problem,
[Music],
What is your greatest joy,
my meandering has been one of my,
greatest joys,
I am proud that I'm have mended,
50-something fifty died on 52 or 54 I,
don't even know the number PhD students,
during my career and that they have gone,
in a huge number of different directions,
because I'm entered them broadly so that,
they had the tools to be able to work,
and anything from an analyst at the CIA,
and one extreme to very abstract,
theoretical physics another extreme in,
the computer industry in management I,
had a student who to students who moved,
into the financial world very very,
successfully and they look back and they,
say far more useful to them than Harvard,
Business School which was a key piece,
for what they wanted to do was doing a,
theoretical physics PhD under me because,
in doing a theoretical physics PhD they,
learned how to take a complex problem,
break it down into pieces that could be,
solved how to how to transform a problem,
into a soluble form and that general,
skill that is the essence of success in,
physics is transferable to all these,
different areas of human enterprise so I,
guess I'm proud of my mentoring and I've,
gained Titan taken great joy in it,
[Music],
What are your favorite bits of advice,
well I have several favorite bits of,
advice the one that I gave particularly,
to my granddaughter who is a physics PhD,
student at Carnegie Mellon University,
now I told her when she said she wanted,
to be a physicist I said if physics is a,
great springboard from which you can,
move in many directions so fine but you,
have to find a direction that you,
absolutely love because if you're going,
to spend a large portion of your life on,
something it has to be something you,
love yes it's also should be something,
that's important something that can help,
the world but you have to love it and,
and this is advice that I got from my,
own grandfather when I was about four or,
five years old he told me Kip if you,
will succeed in life if you find a job,
that is like play and so that's one,
thing you have to be willing to ready to,
eager to work very very hard it does not,
come easily and so that's a second,
second piece of crucial advice a third,
piece of advice is you find your own way,
of functioning I my mind is much slower,
than most of my colleagues Minds and I,
discovered that when I was an,
undergraduate and I struggled for the,
first year and a half as an,
undergraduate at Caltech where I spent,
most of my subsequent career that I,
developed my own ways of learning things,
of keeping records of what I was,
learning working things out in my own,
way and notebooks and so forth that,
enabled me to achieve despite having a,
slow working mind it's so I advise,
students you find your own way and you,
have to experiment of mastering material,
and your own directions that you can be,
successful in and everybody is different,
and we can all succeed in different ways,
How did you get into movies,
almost everything that I have done was,
something I never planned to do that was,
true of like no gravitational waves,
I've watched through Michael entire,
career my lifeline my lifetime,
particularly as an adult for,
opportunities unexpected opportunities,
and that just basically about what,
gravitational waves were I came along at,
just the right time to do this together,
with barish and Weiss and I jumped on,
the opportunity once I saw that it had a,
real possibility succeed similarly I,
never intended to be involved in movies,
but I was single in Southern California,
for about nine years and I dated in,
Hollywood and one of the people that I,
dated was a woman named Linda orbs she,
it was a movie producer just it just,
arrived in Hollywood at the time and I,
was single and so our romance never went,
anywhere because perhaps I was too much,
of a nerd for her and she was perhaps,
too intense for me but we became very,
close friends and she's a close friend,
of my wife Carol II as well today,
and so many years later Linda telephoned,
me and she said would you like to,
brainstorm with me for a movie and I,
thought for a very short time and said,
yes yes I could see immediately one it,
would be fun I would be working with,
brilliant people who were very different,
from me and that's particularly fun and,
I would have a possibility to to convey,
through a Hollywood movie the beauties,
and power of science to an audience of,
well what turned out to be about a,
hundred million people who bought,
tickets to this movie and how else can a,
professor reach a hundred million people,
so so I said yes and so we brainstorm,
and we created the ideas for a movie she,
brought Christopher Nolan and John,
Jonathan Nolan on board to write this,
let's write the screenplay directed they,
completely changed our story but kept,
all the science that,
put into the movie in there and so it,
turned out to be a wonderful,
collaboration between me and these,
filmmakers about a movie in which the,
movie is really based on and has steeped,
in the real science,
What do you think of popular culture,
you know popular culture has tremendous,
potential for inspiring people about,
real science I don't know how effective,
we can be about educating people about,
real science interstellar was not an,
education process it was more of an,
inspiration process with the still I,
wrote a book to go along with a movie,
called the science of an interstellar,
which is my attempt to provide education,
in addition but I think popular culture,
can provide tremendous inspiration about,
science and can convey some of the ethos,
of science but hard to convey the basic,
ideas with any precision obviously well,
What are your favorite films,
I think my two favorite films that,
weren't necessarily scientific were the,
two that proceeded in mind that were,
also I had the science built into them,
from the beginning 2001 a Space Odyssey,
where physicist arthur c clarke provided,
the underpinnings for it it was Stanley,
Kubrick's film and then the movie,
contact where Carl which was a,
collaboration between Carl Sagan and,
Linda Oakes the same woman that I,
collaborated with make to make,
interstellar it's the beginning of that,
for that film it was Carl Sagan's film,
and in both cases again the science was,
embedded so deeply it was inextricably,
interwoven with the film and I have,
loved that,
How did you work on Interstellar,
[Music],
in small ways but not major ways so in,
interstellar I worked very closely with,
a visual effects team a computer,
graphics people at the company double-,
where the lead person is is Paul,
Franklin who got the academy award for,
the visual effects in an interstellar,
and in order to make the beautiful,
images of the black hole gas around the,
black hole a swirling gas around the,
black hole the wormhole in that film it,
was necessary to create a whole new way,
of going from a computer simulation to,
visuals on a screen and and so the,
Oliver James who is the chief scientist,
at double- and I worked out this new,
method to do it which was necessary,
because you could not get the high,
resolution smooth images that were,
required for this science fiction movie,
in any other way but the methods that we,
devised are now being used by,
astrophysicists as part of their,
visualization of simulations they do of,
things like black holes and accretion,
discs around black holes and neutron,
stars colliding neutron stars and so,
forth so there's a feedback in that,
sense but I think beyond that the key,
the direction of the feeding is largely,
from the science into the film and,
through that to a popular culture,
What is your current career,
so you know my current career at the,
interface with arts of the Arts which is,
not just movies it's music with hot,
zimmer and visual effects multimedia,
concerts it is a book I'm working on of,
my poetry and paintings by a superb,
young painter my new career is is my,
hobby in some sense I thought oh these,
interfaces with with the arts but also,
my wife and I just enjoy each other and,
we have a wonderful time we in very,
extreme moderation we don't have that,
much time for it but what we hike we,
scuba dive and we ski but not very much,
in the last few years the last few years,
have just been too hectic,
the kind of work that I do and whether,
it's working on a movie searching for,
ideas for a movie or in physics you can,
I collect information problems issues,
that I'm struggling with during the day,
day after day and I may be struggling,
with some issue some issue of how do you,
depict something in a movie or how do,
you solve a particular physics problem I,
may collect all this information related,
to it during the day for a few days then,
in the middle of the night the,
inspiration comes somehow things connect,
together in the middle of the night I,
get up going the bathroom and write,
notes and go back to bed and usually the,
notes are fairly coherent and often they,
have the key idea that I couldn't get in,
any other way my mind has to go more or,
less blank and things have to just,
somehow naturally start fitting,
themselves together and in a,
semi-conscious state and that's where,
the inspirations come,
Warped Side of the Universe,
gravitational waves are a tool to,
explore what I like to call the Warped,
side of the universe these are objects,
and phenomena they're not made from,
matter like you and I and people,
watching this video but instead are made,
from warp space and warp time a black,
hole is the prime example black hole is,
made from warped space the diameter of,
black hole is huge compared to the,
circumference whereas normally,
circumference is bigger time slows to a,
halt near the surface of a black hole,
you see this in an interstellar where,
Cooper's daughter Murph Cooper at being,
Matthew McConaughey Murph being Jessica,
Chastain daughter Murph ages from age 11,
to 95 at while Cooper ages hardly at all,
because Cooper goes near a black hole,
and where time slows so near a black,
hole time slows down inside a black hole,
time flows in a direction you would have,
thought was a space direction toward the,
center but that's the direction time,
flows black hole drags space into,
whirling motion like the errand or,
tornado the black hole is made from,
warped space and time and colliding,
black holes create a veritable storm in,
the fabric of space and time there are,
other phenomena on the walked side of,
the universe the birth of the universe,
itself,
the earliest moments of the universe,
space and time tremendously warped,
things called cosmic strings where the,
circumference around this sort of rubber,
band-like object is less than pi times,
the diameter and these weird things that,
are made more up space and time are a,
wonderful topic for a book about the,
warped side of the universe and so this,
book is a collaboration between Leah,
Halloran who's a young painter and,
photographer,
who is good enough to have sold pieces,
to the Guggenheim Museum in New York oh,
she's in her 30s and so it's her,
paintings of these phenomena of the,
storm and the factory of space and time,
to produce his gravitational waves,
cosmic streams and produce gravitational,
waves so her paintings in my poetry,
about it and so I've never shown anybody,
except my wife hardly any of my poetry,
my attempts at poetry if my poetry is so,
bad that it makes the book this book be,
a total loser and doesn't sell but two,
copies one to her and one to me well,
that's all right I've had success,
elsewhere and and if I drag her down,
that's all right she's had success,
elsewhere so we're having fun doing,
something that's different for us and it,
perhaps people will enjoy it I enjoy the,
process very much of working with,
creative people who are very different,
than I am and trying to do something,
different from what I've done before,
Poetry vs Physics,
all right now the harder thing for me,
writing poems is a lot harder than doing,
physics because it's new but that's why,
I'm doing it I've done physics for most,
of my life I've been doing physics in a,
serious sort of a way for more than half,
a century and so uh it's do something,
different that is also very hard because,
I'm very new at it so that's the,
challenge and that's the joy,
