"Hi, I'm Bill Ackman.",
I'm the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management and I'm here today to talk to you about everything you need to know about finance and investing and I'm going to get it done in an hour and,
you'll be ready to go. How to Start and Grow a Business,
So let's begin. We're going to go into business together.,
We're going to start a company and we're going to start a lemonade stand and now I,
"don't have any money today, so I'm going to have to raise money from investors to launch the business. So how am I going to do that? Well I'm going to form a corporation.",
That is a little filing that you make with the State and you come up with a name for a business.,
"We'll call it Bill's Lemonade Stand and we're going to raise money from outside investors. We need a little money to get started, so we're going to start our business with 1,000",
shares of stock. We just made up that number and we're going to sell 500 shares more for a $1 each to an,
investor. The investor is going to put up $500. We're going to put up the name and the idea.,
"We're going to have 1,000 shares. He is going to have 500 shares. He is going to own a third of the business for his $500.",
"So what is our business worth at the start? Well it's worth $1,500. We have $500 in the bank plus $1,000 because I came up with the idea for the company.",
"Now I'm going to need a little more than $500, so what am I going to do? I'm going to borrow some money. I'm going to borrow from a friend and he's going to lend me $250 and we're going to",
pay him 10% interest a year for that loan. Now why do we borrow money instead of just selling more stock?,
"Well by borrowing money we keep more of the stock for ourselves, so if the business is successful we're going to end up with a bigger percentage of the profits.",
So now we're going to take a look at what the business looks like on a piece of paper. We're going to look at something called a balance sheet and a balance sheet tells,
"you where the company stands, what your assets are, what your liabilities are and what your net worth or shareholder equity is.",
"If you take your assets, in this case we've raised $500. We also have what is called goodwill because we've said the business-in exchange for the $500 the person who put up the money only got a third of the business.",
"The other two-thirds is owned by us for starting the company. That is $1,000 of goodwill for the business.",
"We borrowed $250. We're going to owe $250. That is a liability. So we have $500 in cash from selling stock, $250 from raising debt and we owe a $250 loan",
"and we have a corporation that has, and you'll see on the chart, shareholders' equity of $1,500, so that's our starting point.",
Now let's keep moving. What do we need to do to start our company?,
We need a lemonade stand. That's going to cost us about $300. That is called a fixed asset. Unlike lemon or sugar or water this is something like a building that you buy and you build,
"it. It wears out over time, but it's a fixed asset. And then you need some inventory. What do you need to make lemonade?",
You need sugar. You need water. You need lemons. You need cups. You need little containers and perhaps some napkins and you need enough supplies to let's,
say have 50 gallons of lemonade in our start of our business. Now 50 gallons gets us about 800 cups of lemonade and we're ready to begin.,
"Let's take a new look at the balance sheet. So now we've spent $500 on supplies. We only have $250 left in the bank, but our fixed assets are now $300.",
"That is our lemonade stand. Our inventory is $200. Those are the supplies and things, the lemons that we need to make the lemonade.",
"Goodwill hasn't changed at 1,000, so our total assets are $1,750 and we still owe $250",
"to the person who lent us the money. Shareholder equity hasn't changed, so we haven't made any money. All we've done is we've taken cash and we've turned it into other assets that we're",
going to need to succeed in our lemon stand business. So let's make some assumptions about how our business is going to do over time.,
"We're going to assume we're going to sell 800 cups of lemonade a year. That's not a particularly ambitious assumption, but we should assume the lemonade business is fairly seasonal. Most of the lemonade sells will happen over the summer.",
"We're going to assume that each cup we can sell for $1 and it's going to cost us about $530 per year to staff our lemonade stand. So now let's take a look at the income statement, so the income statement talks about the profitability,",
"about the revenues that the business generated, what the expenses are and what is left over for the owner of the company.",
"So we've got one lemonade stand. We're selling 800 cups of lemonade at our stand. We're charging $1, so we're generating about $800 a year in revenue and we're spending",
$200 on inventory. There is a line item here called COGS. That stands for cost of goods sold.,
"We have depreciation because our lemonade stand gets a bit beat up over time and it wear out over five years, so it depreciates over 5 years.",
We've got our labor expense for people to actually pour the lemonade and collect cash,
"from customers and we have a profit. We have EBIT and that is earnings before interest and taxes, of $10.",
That is kind of our pretax profit for the business. We didn't make very much money because you take that pretax profit of $10 and you compare,
it to our revenues. It's about a 1.3% margin. That is not a particularly high profit.,
Now we've got to pay interest on our debts and we have a loss of $15 and then we don't,
"have any taxes, but at the end of the day we still lose money. So the question is, is this a particularly good business? Well we're losing money and our cash is basically going down over time. Is this a business we want to stay in?",
"Now the cash flow statement takes the income statement and figures out what happens to the cash in the company's till, so when you put up $750, some money goes to pay for a lemonade stand. Some money is lost selling the product and at the end of the day we started with $750 and now we only have $500. Let's look at the balance sheet.",
"What has happened? Our cash has gone down from 750 to 500. Our fixed assets have gone from 300 to 240. That means our lemonade stand is starting to wear out. Goodwill hasn't changed. We still owe $250 and our shareholder's equity is now down to $1,490, so it was the",
"1,500 we started with minus the $10 we lost over the course of the year. So should we continue to invest in the business? We've lost money in the first year. Is it time to give up? Well let's think about it. Let's make some projections about what the company is going to look like over the next",
several years. Let's assume that we take all the cash the business generates and we're going to use it to buy more lemonade stands so we can grow. Let's assume we're not going to take any money out of the company and we're not going,
"to pay a dividend. We're going to keep all the money in the company and reinvest it. Let's assume that we're going to-as we build our brand we can charge a little more each year, so we're going to raise our prices about a nickel, five cents more",
for each cup of lemonade each year and then we're going to assume we can sell 5% more cups per stand per year.,
So we've got built in growth assumptions. Now let's take a look at the company.,
So if you take a look at this chart you'll see in year one we started out with one lemonade stand.,
We add one a year and then by year five we're up to seven because we've got a big expansion plan.,
Our price per cup goes up a nickel a year and our revenue goes from $800 and starts to grow fairly quickly and the growth comes from increased prices for cups of lemonade,
"and it also comes from opening more stands. So by year five we have almost $8,000 in revenue.",
"Our costs are relatively constant, which is the lemonade and the sugar. That's about $1,702.",
"We have depreciation as more and more stands start to wear out over time. We've got labor expense, but by year five the business is actually doing pretty well.",
We went from a 1.3% margin to over a 28% margin. The business is now up to scale.,
"We're starting to cover some of our costs. We're growing. We're still paying $25 a year in interest for our loan and we have earnings before taxes,",
"after interest of $2,300 by the end of year 5. So we put $500 into the business.",
"We borrowed 250 and by year five we're making a profit of $2,300. That sounds pretty good.",
"Now we have to pay taxes to the government. That is about 35% and we generate net income or another word for profits of $1,500 by the",
fifth year and about a dollar a share. So if you think about this our friend put up $500 to buy 500 shares of stock.,
He paid a dollar and after five years if our business goes as we expect he is actually making a dollar a share in profit.,
"That sounds like a pretty good deal. So what has been the growth? The growth has been fairly dramatic over the period and that is what has enabled us to become a successful business. Now these are just projections, but if they're reasonable projections this might be a business",
that we want to start or invest in. Now let's look at the cash flow statement. So as the business becomes more and more profitable we generate more and more cash and the cash,
"builds up in the company. We go from $500 of cash in the company to over $2,000 of cash over the period.",
"The balance sheet, again, the starting balance sheet had shareholder's equity of $1,490,",
but as the business becomes more profitable the profits add to the cash. They add to the assets of the company.,
"Our liabilities have not changed and the business continues to build value over time. So again by the end of year five we've got $4,000 of shareholder equity and that's",
almost three times what it was when we started. Good vs. Bad Businesses,
Now is this a good business or a bad business? How do we think about whether it's good or bad?,
One thing to think about is what kind of earnings are we achieving compared to how much money went into the company.,
"Now this is a business that we valued at $1,500 when we started. Someone put up $500 for a third of the company.",
"We gave it a $1,500 value. By the end of year five it's earning over $1,500 in earnings, so that's over a 100%",
return on the money that we put into the company. That's actually quite a high number. We spent-let's talk about return on capital.,
"We've spent $2,100 in capital building lemonade stands and we earned $2,336 in year five on",
the capital we invested. That's over 100% return on capital. That is a very attractive return.,
"Earnings have grown at a very rapid rate, 155% per annum. This is really a growth company and our profitability has gone from 1.3% to 28.6% by year five and",
that sounds pretty attractive and it is. So let's look at the person who put up the loan.,
"Well that person put up $250 and the business has been profitable. We've been able to pay them their interest of 10% a year, $25 a year and they're happy",
because they put up $250. They're getting a 10% return on their loan and the business is worth well more than $250.,
"We've got more than that in cash. As a result, they're in a safe position, but they've only made 10% on their money.",
"Now let's compare that with the equity investor, the person who bought the stock in the company. That person earned a dollar a share in year five versus an investment of a dollar a share,",
so he is earning over 100% or about 100% return on his investment versus only 10% for the,
"lender. So who got the better deal? Well obviously the equity investor. Now why did the equity investor, why do they have the right to earn so much more than the",
lender? The answer is they took more risk. If the business failed the lender is entitled to the first $250 of value that comes from,
"liquidating the company, so if you sell off the lemonade stands and you only get $250",
"the lender gets back all their money. They're safe. They got their 10% return while the business was going. They got back their $250, but the equity investor, the person who bought the stock is wiped out",
because they come after the lender.,
So what is the difference between debt and equity? Debt tends to be a safer investment because you have a senior claim on the assets of a,
"company and it comes in lots of different forms. You've heard of mortgage debt on a home. That's a secured loan secured by a house, but you could have mortgage debt on a building",
"for a company. There is senior debt. There is junior debt. There is mezzanine debt. There is convertible debt, but the bottom line, it's all debt.",
It comes in different orders of priority in a company and the rate your charge is inversely,
"related to your security, so the better the security and the less risk the lower the interest rate you're entitled to receive.",
"The more junior the loan the higher the interest rate you're entitled to receive, but you can avoid the complexity.",
"All you need to think about is debt comes first. It's a safer loan, but you're profit opportunity is limited.",
Now the equity also has their varying forms. There is something called preferred equity or preferred stock. There is common equity or common stock and again stock and equity are basically synonyms.,
"They're options, but really not worth talking about today. The important point is that equity gets everything that is left over after the debt is paid off,",
so it's called a residual claim. Now the good thing about the residual claim is that business grows in value if you don't,
"owe your lender anymore, but all that value goes to the stock holder. So the question is why was the lender willing to take only a 10% return when the equity",
earned a much higher rate of return and the answer is when the business started there was no way of knowing whether it would be successful or not and the lender made a bet,
"that if the business failed they could sell off the lemonade stand. It cost $300 to make it. They would have some lemons, some lemonade.",
"Even if they sold it at a much lower price than the dollar they originally projected the lender felt pretty comfortable that they would get their money back, whereas the stockholder",
"is really taking a risk. They were betting on the profitability of the company and they were taking a risk that if it failed they would lose their entire investment, so they were entitled to get a",
higher return or have the potential to have a higher return in the event the business we successful.,
"So let's talk about risk. Lots of different ways people think about risk, but the one that we think is the most",
important-you know a lot of people talk about risk in the stock market as the risk of stock prices moving up and down every day. We don't think that's the risk that you should be focused on.,
"The risk you should be focused on is if you invest in a business what are the chances that you're going to lose your money, that there is going to be a permanent loss.",
"When you're thinking about investing your own money, when you're thinking about one investment versus another don't worry so much about whether the price moves up and",
down a lot in the short term. What matters is ultimately when you get your money back will you earn a return on your,
"investment. How do you think about risk? Well one way to think about risk is to compare your risk to other alternatives, so you could",
"buy government bonds and government bonds are considered today the lowest risk form of investment and the US Treasury issues 10 year, 3 year, 5 year debt.",
"There is a stated interest rate and today a 10 year Treasury you earn about a 3% return. So you give your government $1,000 and you get $30 a year in interest.",
"At the end of 10 years you get your $1,000 back, so that's very, very safe and that sort of provides a floor.",
"Now obviously if you're going to make a loan you can lend money to the government and earn 3%. Well if you can lend money to a lemonade stand you want to earn meaningfully more, so in",
this case the lender is charging a 10% rate of interest. Why 10%?,
Because they want to earn a nice fat spread over what they can make lending to the government because a startup lemonade stand business is a higher risk business.,
"Equity investors sort of think about things similarly, so the higher the valuation-the",
more risky the business the higher the rate of return the equity investor is going to,
expect and the lower the risk business the lower the return the equity investor is going to expect and equity investors don't get interest the same way a lender does.,
What equity investors get is they get the potential to received dividends over the life of a company.,
Let's talk about raising capital. You started this lemonade business. Now the point of this was to make money in the first place.,
"The business is doing very well yet I, having started the business coming up with a name",
"and the concept, hired all the people, I've made nothing, right. So the business has grown in value, but where is my money?",
"I need money to buy a car for example, so I want to buy a car for $4,000. What are my choices? What can I do?",
Well we've taken all the cash the business has generated. We've reinvested it in the business. Now the good news is we've taken all that money.,
We've been able to use it to buy more lemonade stands and these lemonade stands are more and more productive and it's grown the value of the business faster and faster.,
"Now my alternatives could included instead of growing the business so quickly, instead of investing in more lemonade stands I could simply have paid dividends to myself.",
"Now the good news about that is I get money along the way, but the bad news about that is the business wouldn't grow as quickly and if you have a business as profitable as",
this lemonade stand company and you just open a new lemonade stand and people earn-we can earn hundreds of dollars in each new stand it makes sense to keep investing.,
"Well how do I keep my business going and growing, taking advantage of the opportunities, but take some money off the table?",
"How do I do that? Well I could sell the company, so I could sell my lemonade stand business. I started this one in New York. Maybe there is someone in New Jersey who wants to buy me, consolidate with my lemonade stand",
company. Well the problem with that is once I sell it I can no longer participate in the opportunity going forward and I believe in this business.,
I think it's going to be very successful over time. So that's one alternative. The other alternative is I could pay a dividend.,
"We have by year five, over $2,000 sitting in the bank, so I could pay that money out to the shareholders of the company, but that would really slow my rate of growth going forward because I couldn't afford to build and buy more lemonade stands and it's not",
"the $4,000 that I need in order to raise money. So I'm going to look at taking a business public. What does that mean?",
"Well first of all, before we take our business public we want to think about what it's worth.",
It's year five. We've been doing a good job. We've got a business that is profitable. Everything seems to be going well.,
Well the problem is I've got some personal needs. I've started this company. I've taken all the cash the business generates.,
I've reinvested the cash in the business. I bought more and more lemonade stands. The growth is accelerating.,
"I feel great about it, but I need money. How do I get money? What do I do?",
"Well I've got a company that generates a lot of cash each year, but I've been reinvesting the cash, so one alternative is perhaps I don't grow as quickly.",
I don't buy as many lemonade stands and I start sending that money back to me in the form of a dividend. So each year I pay out some amount of cash in the company.,
"My need is really greater than that. There is only about $2,000 in the company today. If I sent that out that is half of what I need to by a car. So how do I get the rest of the money or how do I get more money?",
"Well I could sell the company, so that's one alternative, but the problem there is I've got this really good business. It's growing really quickly.",
"Why would I want to get rid of it at this point? So what should I do? The other alternatives, other than selling 100% of the business is to sell a piece of the business and I can do that privately.",
I can find an investor who wants to buy a private interest in the company and if the,
business is worth enough I can sell them a piece of the business and we can be successful.,
"The other alternative is I can take the business public. Everyone has probably heard of an IPO, an internet company is going public, people getting rich on an IPO. What is interesting is an IPO doesn't make someone rich.",
All it really does is it takes a business that they already own and it sells a piece,
of it to the public and it gets listed on an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange.,
"An IPO, the abbreviation stands for initial public offering and it's initial because it's the first time a company is going public.",
Going public means you're selling stock to the broad general public as opposed to finding one investor buying interest in the company and its offering because you're,
offering people the opportunity to participate and the way to do that actually is you get a good lawyer.,
"You get a good bank, investment bank. It's going to be your underwriter and you're going to put together a document called a prospectus, which is going to talk about all the risks and the opportunities associated",
with investing in your company. It's going to have history of how the business is done over time.,
It's going to have the balance sheet that we talked about. It's going to have income statements from the previous several years.,
It's going to have cash flow statements and investors are going to read that document and they're going to learn about whether this is a business they want to invest in,
and how to think about what price they want to pay for it. When you decide you want to take your business public you're going to have to reveal a,
lot of information to the public in order to attract investors to participate and the Securities and Exchange Commission they're going to study this prospectus very carefully.,
They're going to make sure that you disclose all the various risks associated with investing in the company and you're also going to have an opportunity to talk about the business.,
It's some combination of a marketing document as well as a list of the appropriate risks,
that people should consider before buying stock in the company. That takes time to prepare. It costs money to prepare.,
You're going to need good lawyers. You're going to need a good investment bank and you're going to go through a process where you're going to make a filing with the FCC with a copy of the initial what's,
called registration statement for the offering or the prospectus. The FCC is going to comment on it and eventually you're going to have a document that you,
"can then sell shares to the public. That is kind of an exciting time for you because when you sell shares to the public that's really, in most cases, the way to get the optimally high price for the company, but",
"you don't have to sell 100% of the business to the public. In fact, typically you only sell a small percentage. You get to keep the rest.",
"You get to keep control of the company, but you get to raise money in the offering and you can use that money to buy the car that we were talking about before.",
Now before you decided to go public or even to sell it at all it's probably a good idea to figure out what the business is worth.,
So let's talk about valuation or how to value a business. One way to think about the value of your business is to compare it to other similar businesses.,
Now the stock market is actually a pretty interesting place to look. Now the stock market is a list of companies that have sold shares to the public and you,
"can look in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or online, on Yahoo Finance or Google or other sites and look at stock prices for Coke, for MacDonald's and what",
those stock prices tell you is what the value of the company is. And how do you figure out the value of the company?,
Well you look at where the stock price is. You count how many shares are outstanding. The shares outstanding will be listed in various filings with the FCC.,
"You multiply the shares outstanding times the stock price. That tells you the price you're paying for the equity of the company, so if you go back",
"to our example of our little lemonade stand we have 1,500 shares of stock outstanding. We sold them for a dollar initially, one-third of them to an investor and the business initially",
"had a value of $1,500. So what is the business worth today? Well one way to look at it; let's look at other lemonade stand companies.",
"Let's assume other lemonade stand companies have sold either in the private market, the public market for a price of 10 times earnings or 10 times profit, so that will give you",
a sense of value. You could look at the stock market if there are other examples of a business similar to a lemonade stand company.,
"Perhaps a company that sold soda every month would be a good example, but let's use a",
comparable example. So let's assume another lemonade stand company is trading at 20 times earnings in the stock,
market. Well we earned a dollar per share in year five.,
"If we put a 20 multiple on that dollar the business is worth, according to the comparable about $20 per share.",
"We've got 1,500 shares outstanding. We multiply 1,500 times 20. Now our business is worth $30,000. So we had a company that started out at 1,500, five years later it's worth $30,000.",
"That's actually quite good. Well how do we raise $4,000 if that's the appropriate value for our business?",
"Well if we sold 200 of our shares, 200 of our shares that are today now worth $20 a share we could raise the $4,000 that we are talking about.",
Now what would that do? What would happen if we sold 200 of our shares in the market? Well our interest in the business would go down because today we own 66 and 2/3 percent,
"or 2/3 of the company. A third is owned by our private investors. Well if we sold stock in the market, if we sold 200 of the shares that we would own our",
"ownership would go from 67% to 53%, so the good news there is we'd still have control",
of the business because in most public companies owning a majority allows you to control the,
"business going forward, but because the company is now owned by public shareholders you have",
"to make sure their interests are properly represented, so you have to have a board of",
"directors, a group of individuals who represent the interests of the shareholders who have",
a duty to make sure that their shareholders are treated properly and you wouldn't have,
the same degree of flexibility you had when you were a private company because you have other constituencies that you need to think about.,
Now the benefit of the IPO is the stock would now be liquid. There would be a market where it would trade in the public markets and then over time if,
I wanted to sell more stock I could do so or if new investors wanted to come in they,
could buy stock and our stock would now be liquid.,
It would make me feel better about this business in terms of my ability to at some point exit,
or if a I wanted to raise more money I could sell stock fairly easily in the market because each day you could look up the price either on the web or in the New York Times or otherwise,
"and you could figure out what your business is worth. Okay, now how does this matter to you?",
Now the purpose of the example of our lemonade stand is just going to give you a primer on,
"what companies are, what they do, how they earn profits, what the various reports they provide to investors so investors can figure out what they're worth and the purpose of",
this lecture is to give you a sense of some of the things you need to think about when,
"you're thinking about investing perhaps some of your own money whether you want to invest in a lemonade stand or you want to invest in a company on the market, so a few",
basic points to think about. One of the most important is if you're going to be a successful investor it makes a lot of sense to start early.,
Now that's kind of a hard thing. Today you're probably a student. You don't have a lot of spare money.,
Keys to Successful Investing Well let's assume at 22 you have a pretty good job. Instead of spending your money on gadgets or a fancy apartment or not so fancy apartment,
"or going out and drinking a fair amount you put some money aside and you start investing money. Let's say you could save $10,000 at 22 and you can earn a 10% return on that money between",
now and the time you retire. What would you have in 43 years?,
"The answer, if you put aside $10,000, you don't save another penny and you invested",
"it in your and you earned 10% on your money each year you'd have $600,000 in year 43 and the reason for that is well in year 1 your $10,000 will become 11, in year 2 your",
"$11,000 would grow by 10% and so you would be earning interest not just on your original principle, but you'd earn interest on the interest you had earned the previous year",
and that compounding effect allows money to grow in an almost exponential fashion. Now obviously if you earn more than 10% you can earn even higher returns.,
"Now that's if you put $10,000 aside at 22 you'd have $600,000 in 43 years.",
That's pretty good. What is you had to wait until you were 32 when you earn the same 10% per annum?,
"The problem there is by year 33 you'd only have $232,000. Maybe that is not enough to retire, so the key thing here is if you're going to be",
an investor one of the most valuable assets you have today as someone who is 18 or 19 years-old is your youth. You want to start early so that your money can grow over time.,
Now what if you could earn 15%? I'll give a you better sense of how powerful compounding is because remember at 10% for,
"43 years you'd have $600,000. That's pretty good, but if you earned 15% you'd have over 4 million. Now you're in a pretty good position and so obviously making smart decisions about",
where you put your money has a huge difference in what you're retirement assets are.,
"Now obviously if could put aside more than $10,000, if you could put aside $10,000 each",
"year then you're wealth would be quite enormous. Now just for fun if you were one of the world's great investors, Warren Buffet being a good",
"example, if you could earn 20% per year for 43 years you'd have 25 million dollars.",
"Again the original $10,000 investment would increase about 2,500 times over that period of time just by earning a 20% return.",
"Albert Einstein said the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest, so the key is start early, earn an attractive return and avoid losing money and you're going",
"to have a very nice retirement. Okay, now let's talk about the risk of losing money.",
Now let's assume that in order to try to get a 20% return you took a lot of risk and,
it turns out that every 12 years you lost half your money because you just made-you,
"hit a bad patch in the market or you made dumb decisions. Well your 25 million dollars at 20% would now only be worth a million eight in 43 years,",
"so a key success factor here is not just shooting for the fences, trying to get the highest",
"return. It's avoiding significant loses over the period. Okay, so as Warren Buffet says rule number one in investing is never lose money and rule",
"number two is never forget rule number one, so if you can avoid loses and earn an attractive return over time you're going to have a lot of money if you can stick at it for a",
long period of time. So how do you be a successful investor? Now I'm assuming that you're not going to go into the business of investing.,
"I'm assuming that you're going to be a doctor or a lawyer. You're going to pursue your passion, but you're going to have some money that you're",
"going to save over time and I'm going to give you my advice on the topic. It's not necessarily definitive advice, but it's the advice I would give my sister,",
"my grandmother on what she should do if she were in the same position. I think that's probably the right way to think about it. So number one, how do you avoid losing money?",
What are the good places to invest? My first piece of advice is despite the story about the lemonade stand I'd avoid investing,
in lemonade stands. I'd avoid investing in startup businesses where the prospects are not very well known,
because again you don't need to make 100% a year to have a fortune.,
"You just need to invest at an attractive return 10, 15 percent over a long period of time.",
"Your money grows very significantly. So how do you avoid the riskiest investments? My advice would be to invest in public securities, invest in listed companies, companies that",
"trade on the stock market. Why, because those businesses tend to be more established. They have to meet certain hurdles before they go public.",
"The stocks are liquid, so you can change your mind if you want to sell. If you invest in a private lemonade stand it's hard to find someone to take you out",
"of that investment unless that business becomes fabulously profitable. So that's piece of advice number one, invest in public companies. Number two, you want to invest in businesses that you can understand.",
"What I mean by that is there are lots of businesses that you come in that you deal with in the course of your day in your personal life, whether it's a retail store that you know",
"because you like shopping there or it's a product, your iPad that you think is a great product, but you have to understand how the company makes money.",
"If the business is just too complicated, you don't understand how they make money, even if they've had a great track record I would avoid it and a lot of people thought Enron",
"was an incredible business because it appeared to have a good track record, but very few people understood how they made money. It was good to avoid it.",
"Another very important criterion is you want to invest at a reasonable price. It could be a fabulous business that is done very well over a long period of time, but",
if you pay too much for it you're not going to earn a very good return investing in that,
company. The last bit is that you want to invest in a business that you could theoretically own forever.,
If the stock market were to close for 10 years you wouldn't be unhappy. What do I mean by that? Again if you're going to compound your money at a 10 or 15 percent return over a 43 year,
period of time you really want a business that you can own forever. You don't want to constantly have to be shifting from one business to the next.,
And what are businesses that you can own forever? Well there are very few that sort of meet that standard.,
Maybe a good example is Coca Cola. What is good about Coca Cola? It's a relatively easy business to understand.,
You understand how Coke makes money. They sell a formula or syrup to bottlers and to retail establishments and they make a profit,
every time they serve a Coca Cola. People drank a lot of Coca Cola for a very long period of time.,
The world's population is growing. They sell it in almost every country in the world and each year people drink a little,
"bit more Coca Cola, so it's a pretty easy business to understand and it's also a business",
that I think is unlikely to be competed away as a result of technology or some other new,
product. It's been around long enough. People have grown used to the taste. Parents give it to their children and you can expect it will be around a long period,
of time. I think that's one good example. Another good example might be MacDonald's. You may not love MacDonald's hamburgers.,
"You may or you may not, but it's a business that it has been around for 50 years.",
You understand how they make money. They open up these little-build these little boxes. They rent them to the franchisees.,
They charge them royalties in exchange for the name and they sell hamburgers and French fries and you know what?,
People have to eat. It's relatively low cost food. The quality is pretty good and they continue to grow every year.,
So I think the consistent message here is try to find a business that you can understand that's not particularly complicated that has a successful long term track record that,
makes an attractive profit and can grow over time. So what are the key things to look for in a business as I say that lasts forever?,
Well you want a business that sells a product or a service that people need and that is somewhat unique and they have a loyalty to this particular brand or product and that,
people are willing to pay a premium for that. Another good example might be a candy business.,
"While people are going to buy generic versions of many kind of food products, flour, sugar,",
they don't need to have the branded product. When it comes to candy people don't tend to like the Walmart version or the Kmart version.,
They want the Hershey chocolate bar or the Cadbury chocolate bar or the See's Candy.,
They want the brand and they're willing to pay a premium for that and so that's I think a key thing. You want the product to be unique.,
You don't want it to be a commodity that everyone else can sell because when you sell,
a commodity anyone can sell it and they can sell it at a better price and it's very hard to make a profit doing that. If you're investing for the long term you want to invest in businesses that have very,
"little debt. In our little example before we talked about our lemonade stand. There is $250 worth of debt. That didn't put too much pressure on the lemonade stand company, but if it had been",
"$1,000 and we hit a rough patch the business could have gone out of business for failure",
to pay its debts. The shareholders could have been wiped out.,
"So if you can find a company that can earn attractive profits, that doesn't have a lot of debt or they generate vastly more profits than they need to pay the interest on their",
debt that is a safe place to put your money over a long period of time. You want businesses that have what people call barriers to entry. You want a business where it's hard for someone tomorrow to set up a new company to,
compete with you and put you out of business. I mean going back to the Coca Cola example. Coca Cola has such a strong market presence.,
People have come to expect when they go to a restaurant they can ask for a Coke and get a Coke.,
"It's very hard for someone else to break in. Of course there is Pepsi and there are other soda brands, but Pepsi has been around a long",
time and Coca Cola and Pepsi have continued to exist side by side over long periods of time. It's going to be very hard for someone to come in and come up with a new soft drink,
"that is just going to put Coca Cola out of business, so when you're thinking about choosing a company make sure that they sell a product or a service that is hard for someone",
else to make a better one that you'll switch to tomorrow. Look for something where people have real loyalty and they won't switch and it doesn't-even,
"if someone offers the same, similar product for 20% less they still want the branded, high quality product. You also want businesses that are not particularly sensitive to outside factors, so-called extrinsic",
factors that you can't control. So if a business will be affected dramatically if the price of a particular commodity goes up or if interest rates move up and down or if currency prices change. You want a company that is fairly immune to what is going on in the world and I'll use,
my Coca Cola example. I mean if you think about Coca Cola it's a product that has been around probably 120,
"years. Over that period of time there have been multiple world wars. There has been all kinds of you know, development of nuclear weapons, all kinds of unfortunate",
"events and tragedies and so on and so forth, but each year the company pretty much makes a little bit more money than they made before and they're going to be around and you can",
be confident based on the history that this is a business that is going to be around almost,
"regardless of whether interest rates are at 14%, whether the US dollar is not worth very much or the price of gold is up or down.",
"Those are the kind of companies you want to invest in, in the long term, businesses that are extremely immune to the events that are going on in the world.",
"Another criteria, if you think back to our lemonade stand company, as we grew we had",
"to buy more and more lemonade stands. Now those lemonade stands only cost $300 each, but imagine a business where every time you",
grew you had to build a new factory to produce more and more product and those factories,
"were really expensive. Well that company might generate a lot of cash from the business, but in order to grow",
you're going to have to just reinvest more and more cash into the business. The best businesses are the ones where they don't require a lot of capital to be reinvested,
"in the company. They generate lots of cash that you can use to pay dividends to your shareholders or you can invest in new high-return, attractive projects.",
"So the key here is low capital intensity, so let's talk about a low capital intensity",
business. Maybe the best way to think about a low capital intensity business is to think about a high capital intensity business.,
If you think about the auto industry before you produce your first car you have to build a huge factory.,
You've got buy a lot of machine tools. You have to make an enormous investment before you can send your first car out the door and,
"those machine tools wear out over time and as you make more and more cars you have to invest more and more in the factories, so it's a business that historically has not",
been very attractive for the owners of the business. If you looked at the price of General Motors' stock 50 years ago it actually hasn't changed,
meaningfully even up until the last several years before it went bankrupt.,
If you ignored the most recent period up through the bankruptcy of GM very few people made,
money investing in GM over a 40 or 50 year period of time and the reason for that is,
that GM constantly had to reinvest every dollar that they generated to build better and better factories so they can be competitive.,
If you compare that to Coca Cola while Coca Cola there are bottling companies around the,
world a lot of those bottling companies aren't even owned by Coca Cola. What they're really doing is they're selling a formula and in exchange for that formula,
they get a royalty on every dollar that is spent on Coca Cola. Those are the better businesses. Another good example might be American Express.,
If you think about the American Express card when you take your American Express card and,
you buy something American Express card gets a few percent of every dollar that you spend.,
So you put up the capital and they get a several percentage point return on that.,
They get 3% of so of what you spent. So businesses where you own a royalty on other people's capital are the best businesses,
in the world to invest in. I guess the last point I would make is that if you're going to invest in public companies,
it's probably safest to invest in businesses that are not controlled. A controlled company is kind of like our lemonade stand business that we took public.,
"The problem with a controlled company unless the controlling shareholder is someone you completely trust, unless there is someone that has a great track record for taking care",
"of so-called minority investors, the non-controlling shareholders it can be a risk of proposition to invest in that business because you're at the whim of the controlling shareholder",
and even if the controlling shareholder today is someone that you feel comfortable with,
there is no assurance that in the future they might sell control to someone else who is not going to be as supportive of the shareholders of the business.,
So it's not that you just-you can simply have a profitable business and a business that has done well.,
You have to make sure that the management and the people that control the business think about you as an owner and are going to protect your interests.,
So these are some of the key criteria to think about. The Psychology of Investing and Mutual Funds,
Now when are you ready to start investing money? My guess is you're a student. You probably have student loans.,
Perhaps you even have some credit card debt. You're going to graduate. You're going to get a job. So you don't want to jump right in and while you have a lot of debt outstanding start investing,
"in the stock market. The stock market is a place to invest when you've got a good-you have money you can put away that you won't need for 5 years, maybe 10 years.",
So if you're paying relatively high interest rates on your credit cards you definitely want to pay off your credit cards first before you think about investing in the stock market.,
"You student loans are probably lower cost than your credit cards, but again here my best advice would be if your student loans are costing you six or seven percent well",
if you pay them off it's as if you earned a guaranteed six or seven percent return and,
you're just better off getting rid of your credit card debt and even your student loan,
debt before you commit a lot of material amount of money to the stock market.,
So what do you do with your money while you're waiting to invest?,
"The answer is you pay down your debt and you want to have-even once you've paid off your credit card debts, perhaps you paid down your student loans, you want to have enough",
money in the bank so that even if you were to lose your job tomorrow you've got a good,
"6 months, maybe even 12 months of money set aside. So these are some pretty high standards and obviously therefore these make it harder to",
"start investing earlier, but the safest course of action in order to be a successful investor is be as-have as little debt as possible.",
"Be comfortable having some money in the bank, so if you lose your job tomorrow you can live until to find your next opportunity and once you've achieved those goals then put aside money that you don't need to touch. If you can do that then you can be a successful investor.",
"So let's talk a little bit about the psychology of investing, so we've talked about some of the technical factors, how to think about what a business is worth.",
"You want to buy a business at a reasonable price. You want to buy a business that is going to exist forever, that has barriers to entry, where it's going to be difficult for people to compete with you, but all those things are important, but even-and a lot of investors follow those principles. The problem is that when they put them into practice and there is a panic in the world and the stock market is heading down every day and they're watching the value of their",
IRA or their investment account decline the natural tendency is sort of to do the opposite,
"of what makes sense. Generally it makes sense to be a buyer when everyone else is selling and probably be a seller when everyone else is buying, but just human tendencies, the tendency of the natural",
"lemming-like tendency when everyone else is selling you want to be doing the same thing encourages you as an investor to make mistakes, so a lot of people sold into the crash of",
'87 when in fact they should have been a buyer in that kind of environment. So that's why I talked before a little bit about why it's very important to be comfortable.,
You want to be financially comfortable. If you have student loans you want to have a manageable amount of debt. You probably don't want to be paying any-you don't want to have any revolving credit card debt outstanding.,
You want to have some money in the bank because if you're comfortable then the money that you're risking in the stock market is not going to affect your lifestyle in the short term.,
"As long as you don't need that money tomorrow you can afford to deal with the fluctuations of the stock market and the fluctuations, depending on who you are can have a big impact",
on you. People tend to feel rich when the stocks are going up. They tend to feel poor when the stocks are going down and the reality is the stock market in the short term is what Ben Graham or even Warren Buffet called a voting machine.,
"Really stock prices reflect what people think in the very short term. If affects the supply and demand for investors, buying and selling stocks in the short term. Over the long term however, stocks tend to reflect the value of the businesses they own. So if you're buying businesses at attractive prices and you're owning them over long",
periods of time and those businesses are growing in value you're going to make money over a long period of time as long as you're not forced to sell at any one period of time.,
To be a successful investor you have to be able to avoid some natural human tendencies to follow the herd. When the stock market is going down every day you're natural tendency is to want to sell.,
"When the stock market is actually going up every day your natural tendency is to want to buy, so in bubbles you probably should be a seller. In busts you should probably be a buyer and you have to have that kind of a discipline.",
You have to have a stomach to withstand the volatility of the stock markets. The key way to have a stomach to withstand the volatility of the stock market is to be,
secure yourself. You've got to feel comfortable that you've got enough money in the bank that you don't need what you have invested unless-for many years. That's a key factor.,
"Number two, you have to recognize that the stock market in the short term is what we call a voting machine. It really represents the whims of people in the short term. Stock prices are affected by many things, by events going on in the world that really have nothing to do with the value of certain companies that you're investing in, so you've got to just accept the fact that what you own can go down meaningfully in value after",
you buy it. That doesn't necessarily mean you've made an investment mistake. It's just the nature of the volatility of the stock market. How do you get comfortable? Well the way you get comfortable with the volatility is you do a lot of the work yourself. You don't just buy a stock because you like the name of the company.,
You do your own research. You get a good understanding of the business. You make sure it's a business that you understand. You make sure the price you're paying is reasonable relative to the earnings of the company and we talked before a little bit about earnings and how to look at a value of a business by putting a multiple on earnings.,
"A more sophisticated way to think about a business is to-the value of anything is actually the amount of cash you can take out of it over a very long period of time and people do build models to predict how much cash a business will generate over a long period. That is probably something a little bit more complicated than we're going to get into for the purpose of this lecture, but maybe another way to think about it would be helpful.",
"So when you by a bond and you get an interest rate, so today the 10 year Treasury pays about 3%. You're earning 3% on your investment. When you buy a stock that's trading at a multiple of its profits or a so-called PE ratio or a price to earnings ratio let's say of 10 times it's very similar to a bond. In fact, if you flip over the PE ratio, you put the E on top, what the business is earning",
"and you put the price that you're paying for the stock on the bottom it's what the earnings are per share over the price you get what's called an earnings yield and you can compare that earnings yield to for example the 10 year Treasury, so a company trading at a 10 PE is actually trading at a 10% earning yield, so you can actually think about stocks or buying equity in a business as very similar to buying an interest in a bond.",
"The difference is in the bond you know what the coupon is going to be. You know that 3% interest rate every year for the next 10 years. With stock you don't know what the coupon is going to be. The coupon in the stock is how much profit it earns and you can try to project that profit based on the history of the business and what the prospects are, but that profit is going to move up and down every year.",
"Now hopefully the long term trend is up and so the way I think about the decision between buying a bond or buying a stock is I want to make sure that the earnings yield, that earnings per share over the price I'm paying for the stock is higher than what I could get owning a Treasury and that earnings yield is something that's going to grow over a long period of time. Now if you had a business that was growing at a very, very high rate very often-or",
"growing its profits at a very high rate, very often people are prepared to pay a pretty high multiple of those profits. Why, because they expect that earnings yield to grow, so if you had a business you might even pay-it might be cheap some day to buy a business at 30 times its profits or a 3% or a 3.3% earnings yield if you think that 3.3% is going to grow at a high rate and eventually get meaningfully higher to a 5, a 6, a 7, a 8 or 10 percent rate.",
Those kinds of investments are much riskier. The higher the multiple generally the higher the risk you take because you're betting more on the future of the business. You're betting more on the future profitability. So my basic piece of advice in recommending the MacDonald's and the Coca Cola's of the world are to find businesses that where you're going in yield your earnings yield,
"is high enough that you don't need to be right about a very high rate of growth into the future in order to earn attractive rate of return. Okay, so the few key success factors for being an investor in the stock market are one, do the homework yourself. Make sure you understand the companies that you're investing in. Two, invest money that you won't need for many years and three, limit the amount of-don't",
"borrow money certainly to invest in the stock market and limit that amount of leverage, if any, that you have as an investor. Okay, so after this brief 40 minute lecture I wouldn't just jump in immediately and start investing in the stock market. You have some work to do. There is some books you can read and we're going to provide you with a list of recommended",
"books at the end of the lecture that will help you learn more about investing. Almost everything you need to know about investing you can actually read in a book. I learned the business from reading books as opposed to reading books and the experience associated with starting small and investing in the stock market. Let's say this is just not for you. I don't want to invest, buy individual stocks.",
It just seems too risky. I don't have the time to do my own research. What are your alternatives? Well you alternatives are to outsource your investing to others. You can hire a money manager or you can hire a group of money managers and there are a couple of different alternatives for a startup investor.,
"The most common alternative is mutual fund companies. So what is a mutual fund? A mutual fund is I guess technically it's a corporation, but where you buy stock in this corporation and the manager selects a portfolio of stocks. So what they do is they pool together capital, money from a large group of investors. So say they raise a billion dollars and they take that money and they invest in a diversified",
"collection of securities. Now the benefit of this approach is that with a tiny amount of money, even less than $1,000 you can buy into a diversified portfolio managed by a professional manager who is compensated to do a good job for you investing in the market. So mutual funds are a good potential area for investment. The problem is there are probably 7, 8,000, maybe 10,000 different mutual funds and some",
"are fantastic and some are not particularly good, so you need to do research to find a good mutual fund manager in the same way that you need to find individual stocks, so it's not just the easy thing of just invest in mutual funds. So here are a few key success factors in identifying a mutual fund or a money manager of any kind to select. Number one, you want someone who has an investment strategy that makes sense to you; you understand",
what they do and how they do it. They're not appealing to your insecurity by using complicated words and expressions that you don't understand. If they can't explain to you in two minutes what they do and how they do it and why it makes sense then it's a strategy you shouldn't invest in. Number two and this is not necessarily in this order.,
"This probably should be number one, is you want someone with a reputation for integrity. Again if you're starting out you probably want to invest in some of-a mutual fund that is sponsored by some of the larger mutual fund complexes as opposed to a tiny little mutual fund that is privately-by a mutual fund company that you've never heard of. There is some benefit in the larger institutions that have-you can be more confident that they're not going to steal your money.",
"You want someone, an approach where the investor invests money on the basis of value. Now this sounds kind of obvious, but value investing has a very long term track record and there are other kinds of investing including technical investing where people are betting on stocks based on price movements, but I highly recommend against those kind of approaches. So you want someone making investments where they're buying companies based on their belief that the prospects of the business will be good and that the price paid relative",
"to what the business is worth represents a significant discount. You want to invest with someone that a long term track record and I would say 5 years is the absolute minimum and ideally you want someone who has 10, 15, 20 years of experience investing in the markets because there is a lot that you can learn being a long term investor in the market. You want someone who has a consistent approach, where they haven't changed what they do",
"materially year by year, that they have a stated strategy that they've kept to thick and thin that has enabled them to earn an attractive return over their lifetime as an investor and I always say in some way most importantly you want someone who is investing the substantial majority of their own money alongside yours. Obviously it shouldn't be that they're investing your money. This is what they do for you, but for their money they do something meaningfully different.",
"You want someone whose interests are aligned with yours. If it's a mutual fund you want them to have a lot of money in their own mutual fund. If it's a hedge fund, which is a privately sold fund for investors who have higher net worth you want a manager who is investing alongside you as well. I have a strong aversion to strategies that require the use of leverage, so in the same way you want to invest in companies that use very little debt you want to invest in investment",
strategies that you very little leverage. If you can avoid leverage and invest in high quality businesses or invest with high quality managers it's hard to lose a lot of money versus the use of leverage. Lots of money can be lost. Now in the same way when you're building a portfolio of stocks where you don't want to put all of your eggs in one basket and you want a reasonable degree of diversification,
"and the more sophisticated, the more work you do, the higher the quality the business is you invest in the more concentrated your portfolio can be, but I would say for an individual investor you want to own at least 10 and probably 15 and as many as 20 different securities. Many people would consider that to be a relatively highly concentrated portfolio. In our view you want to own the best 10 or 15 businesses you can find and if you invest in low leverage, high quality companies that's a comfortable degree of diversification.",
"If you invest with money managers you probably don't want to put all your eggs in one basket there either and here you probably want to have two or three different, perhaps four different alternative, mutual funds or money managers, so again there you have some degree of diversification in your holdings. Finance in Our Lives So we spent the hour.",
"We started with a little lemonade stand company and the purpose of that was to give you some of the basics on how to think about a business, where the profits comes from, what revenues are, what expenses are, what a balance sheet is, what an income statement is, how to think about what a business is worth, how to think about what the difference between what a good business is versus a bad business, how debt offered is generally higher, actually lower risk, but lower return, how equity investors or investors who buy the stock or the ownership",
"of a business have the potential to earn more or lose more and we use that background as a way to think about- We use that as the-just as the basics to get someone of the vocabulary to think about investing and we talked about investing in the stock market. We talked about ways to think about how to select investments, how to deal with some of the psychological issues of investing.",
"We covered a fair amount of ground in a relatively short period of time. Now I entitled the lecture Everything you Need to Know about Finance and Investing in Less Than an Hour. Well it really isn't everything you need to know. It's really just an introduction and hopefully I didn't mislead you, induce you to watch this for an hour, but there is a lot more that can be learned and there is wonderful",
"books that can teach you on the topic, so I think what is interesting about investing whether you choose this as a fulltime career or not if you're going to be successful in your career you're going to make some money and how you invest that money is going to make a big difference in the quality of life that you have and perhaps that your children have or the kind of house you're able to buy or the retirement that you're going to be able to enjoy and we talked about the difference between a 10% return and a 15 and",
"a 20% return over a very long lifetime and what impact that has in terms of how much wealth you create over the period, so investing is going to be important to you whether you like it or not and learning more about investing is going to have a big impact on your quality of life if money is something that you need in order to meet some of your goals. So I recommend this as an area worthy of exploration and the more you learn about investing the more-these same concepts while they're useful in deciding how to invest your portfolio",
"they're also useful to you in thinking about decisions like buying a home, making decisions in your line of work, if you're a lawyer whether to hire additional people, these kinds of calculations and thought processes are helpful and they're helpful in life and I recommend that you learn more. So take a look at the reading list and good luck",
hello everyone,
came to Ahmedabad Gandhi nagar majama,
um,
a very few people right,
so today I am going to talk about the,
topic that is very crucial for,
everyone's life especially students,
choosing the career and cracking,
interviews,
on 13th September 2021,
I became CA with all India rank 1 at the,
age of 19. now you would be,
thank you,
now you would be thinking what an,
amazing moment it would have been yes it,
was my entire life changed in a second,
so I am among those kids who were having,
a great clarity in her life that I want,
to become CS since I was in 7th Standard,
but the moment I became CA I was,
figuring out what next what to do now,
what are the career options that I can,
look for,
and with this all India rank 1 came the,
pressure of choosing the right career,
path cracking every single interview,
that I would give and there was a,
different kind of pressure to prove my,
capability that I truly deserve this,
rank,
every fresher has this pressure and I,
understand that but when you get such a,
good rank or you know when you are being,
portrayed as someone who is among the,
top candidates then it's a different,
pressure,
on 16 September right after three days,
of my result I gave my first interview,
after becoming CA in the domain of,
investment banking,
and I was rejected,
it was a sad feeling but I thought okay,
it was a first interview I'll try my,
best in the next one and the feedback I,
got in my first interview was that you,
seem to be too young to handle the,
pressure of investment banking,
then on SEC 22nd September I gave my,
interview in one of the very renowned,
fmcg company which is a dream company,
for many to work with,
esper me interview went decent but on,
30th September I received an email that,
your candidature has not been,
recommended by the panel,
and I was rejected,
on 8th of October I gave an aptitude,
for the leadership program of an Indian,
fmcg company many freshers were,
appearing for this test,
and I didn't qualify the first round,
itself which was the aptitude test and I,
was saying it to myself oh my God who,
gets rejected in the aptitude test,
it didn't end here,
on 20th October I was interviewed by,
Bain and Company which is a big three,
top management consulting firm across,
the world and I didn't get a call after,
the first round itself,
those who were selected they,
went through three different set of,
interviews but I didn't get a call after,
the first one,
the feedback I got was that you need to,
improve your structuring skills,
and I was shattered,
I was broken I was dejected,
I started doubting my capabilities am I,
really need for something Beyond studies,
do I really deserve this rank like what,
is the meaning of such a great result I,
mean on the one hand I got such a great,
result and on the other hand I was,
simultaneously rejected four times,
with the top companies I interviewed,
with,
I just couldn't think of anything at,
that point of time,
I took a break,
for one week I was just thinking should,
I really give any more interviews or not,
and BCG interview was scheduled right,
after one month on 19th of November,
firstly I decided that I won't give any,
more interviews because I don't have,
that courage to again bear the pain of,
getting rejected or being dejected,
but then I thought,
if I don't give this interview maybe two,
three years down the line I would think,
I wish I could have given this interview,
and maybe I would have been working at,
BCG,
and it has been my principle so far that,
I don't want any regrets in my life,
so with that courage but this time with,
no fear of failure with no expectations,
I started preparing for my management,
consulting interview and I gave my,
interview on 19th of November,
at 7 30 pm,
I got to know that I have been selected,
and it was a very happy moment,
when you,
achieve something after failures the,
value the happiness that you get is just,
different,
and I think that if I would have gotten,
into BCG in one go then maybe I would,
not have been the the happiest as I was,
at that point of time,
I think when I became CA I was just,
following what everyone was doing I mean,
someone said you should give investment,
banking interview someone said you,
should try into management consulting,
someone said you should look for private,
Equity these are these are all the top,
profiles,
I was not having any idea and also at,
that point of time my home was filled,
with media people I didn't have time to,
research on my own so I just submitted,
my resume basis whatever advice I got,
and I feel that it was more like a,
guesswork but what if I tell you that,
there is a way to eliminate this,
guesswork and take a systematic approach,
to choose your career,
so it's a three-step approach,
a,
understand reserve the potential career,
path that exists after your education,
B understand what drives you like what's,
your passion what is it that that makes,
you happy,
and see eliminate what you don't like so,
these three things if you keep in mind,
and it would really help you to choose,
the right career path and for,
understanding the potential career path,
knowing about the potential career path,
the best way is to talk to your Mentor,
seniors connect with them on LinkedIn,
like research different job profiles,
for for example when I was figuring out,
I got to know that if I start my career,
with the core Finance job it would be,
difficult for me to switch to the,
business side and that's where I decided,
that I wanted to start my career with,
management consulting,
likewise,
you should also talk to your mentors,
your seniors take some online,
assessments before you take before you,
take any decision about your career,
B just ask yourself what is the,
lifestyle that you would like to live,
three to five years down the line,
so I have done my internship from PWC,
for three years wherein I used to,
interact with different clients work,
across different Industries and I really,
like,
so that was one of the reason that I,
choose to go into management consulting,
because here we work across the,
industries within three months maybe,
five to six months our client keeps on,
changing and it really makes me happy to,
interact with new people every day so,
it's very important to understand your,
passion what drives you,
and see eliminate what you don't like so,
for example when I was doing my,
internship from PWC I get the clarity,
that I don't want to continue with audit,
once I became a CA so that was already,
out of the picture,
eliminating what you don't like helps,
you to narrow down your choices and then,
really focus on what do you like and I'm,
sure after doing this you would build,
with three to four top profiles for,
which you would like to go and then it,
is really easy to make the final choice,
but,
choosing the career is only half the,
battle,
the interviews is the next step wherein,
most people struggle and I also did,
what do you think,
are the two expectations that,
interviewer has in mind or that,
differentiates a candidate from other,
candidates,
this is my experience I think there are,
two things,
what do you present the way you present,
when I say what do you present,
I am referring to the technical,
knowledge,
honesty,
and The Logical thinking,
when I say technical knowledge it,
doesn't just mean whatever you have read,
in your college or your academics or,
whatever education you have pursued so,
far it also means how are you able to,
leverage that theoretical knowledge with,
the requirements of the company so for,
example if you are giving an interview,
for Microsoft or Google just go through,
their annual report just go through,
articles blogs wherein you know they,
would have highlighted some of their,
problems or their projects and then,
analyze okay how can you leverage your,
theoretical knowledge there,
okay,
when I say honesty honesty is something,
that helps you to create the very first,
impression on your interview so I'll,
take an example here,
in my interview I was asked okay what is,
that one thing that your mother hates,
about you,
what is that one thing that your friend,
hates about you,
what is that one thing that your manager,
considers as your weakness,
many times what pressures do they want,
to portray themselves as an idol,
candidate and interviewer is very smart,
to figure that out,
I gave honest answers okay this is the,
thing that my mother hates about me my,
friend it's about me because like no one,
like none of us are ideal in this world,
there is something that everyone hates,
about us but if you are vocal about it,
it shows that even while dealing with,
company people they can trust you,
you have the values like integrity,
like honesty,
and once you are able to build that,
connection with your interviewer and,
whatever you say in the upcoming part of,
the interview,
it would complement that I'm not saying,
that if you say wrong things or if you,
don't get it right then also it would,
support you but honesty is something,
that helps you to build that connect,
I was asked a question,
there is a five by five Rubik Cube you,
dipped it in the blue color you took it,
out you started breaking the cube,
how many cubes would be there with no,
color,
do you know what is the answer,
I took two minutes to solve it but I,
can't,
and I just said that I can't solve it,
and then they asked me have you ever,
solved a puzzle or a cube,
I don't try to cover up I just said,
no I haven't because it it saved time on,
the sides although at that moment I felt,
that maybe it could affect my interview,
in some way or the other but it didn't,
happen the result of the interview,
turned out positive,
but honesty is very important whenever,
you deal with your interviewer or with,
anyone else,
and the third part logical thinking,
in your interview is expecting the exact,
answer from you they would be asking you,
synaptic question,
for example I have been asked a lot of,
questions to which I don't have the,
answer then the interviewer told me we,
don't want the exact answer but we want,
to understand how do you think how do,
you approach the problems to which you,
don't have the answer,
so whatever you say,
make sure that it is logical although it,
not might not be the correct answer,
now moving to the second part the way,
you present,
here I am referring to the tone,
confidence and effectiveness,
when I say tone it means being formal,
and friendly so in my interview,
sometimes it gets a bit casual in the,
way that they start asking me about the,
city about the famous suite and maybe,
something around friends but even in,
this conversation if you are able to,
maintain that formal and friendly tone,
but while also answering the questions,
in an interesting way then it helps you,
to ease the atmosphere in the interview,
and it also shows that whenever you,
would be interacting with your,
colleagues and with someone in the,
formal setting you would be able to,
adjust yourself and I am sure many of,
you would be targeting mncs so this is,
exactly what they are looking for,
the second part the confidence,
confidence is something that not only,
makes you feel good about you but it,
also,
make others feel good about you because,
they are able to count upon you,
when you are confident you are calm it,
shows that even when things are not,
moving well you would be able to,
motivate yourself and also your team,
so during my interview there have been,
times wherein I didn't know the answer,
of,
five or six questions out of ten but,
still I have stated confidently okay I,
don't know the answer and versus the,
interviews wherein I have not been,
confident so I know the difference where,
when you are confident it helps you to,
reflect one of the great attribute of,
yourself that is handling pressure,
nowadays in every organization there's a,
lot of pressure even you would be having,
the pressure of exams,
so be confident in whatever you say in,
your interview and the third part,
effectiveness,
when I say effectiveness,
it means being able to communicate your,
thoughts effectively,
so for example,
it's a very common question that is,
asked in an interview you are working,
with a team of five to six people and,
there is a conflict of opinion between,
three of them,
how will you resolve it,
now there are two ways of answering this,
one,
State some common points like I would,
ensure that,
everyone is heard I would ensure that,
um the final decision is agreed by,
everyone and the second way is to,
demonstrate it with an example so what I,
used to do I used to give an example,
from my experience at PWC on maybe some,
extracurricular experience wherein I,
have been part of the situations and how,
I approached it it helps interview to,
imagine you solving that problem in the,
real life and even while interacting,
with clients basis whatever I have seen,
till now the storytelling The Art of,
Storytelling is very effective,
if you are able to communicate what you,
are trying to say then 70 or 80 percent,
work is done but one thing that I would,
like to share if I compare myself in the,
interviews wherein I have been rejected,
versus the interviews wherein I have,
been selected the difference was that,
I was not nervous I was not anxious I,
was having no fear of losing,
in the interviews wherein I made it,
and that nervous enviousness comes from,
the factor that you are afraid of,
failure if you are able to overcome your,
fear of losing and adopt the positive,
attitude you will be able to discover,
the real you,
and interviewer or any other person in,
this world is there to know the real you,
not the imitated copy of anyone else,
so be you,
in whatever you say,
see all the life is an experiment there,
is no right or wrong that works for,
everyone,
one career path might work for you but,
the same might not work for the other,
set of audience,
so know yourself what really works for,
you,
I am sure you all would have been to an,
even like this is also an event and when,
you register for an event there are some,
terms and conditions like bring your ID,
card or be on time Etc,
so I believe that life is an event with,
an amazing agenda for all of us but the,
only terms and condition is you go,
without fear so let go all the fears and,
the world is yours thank you,
JIM DONOVAN: So the topic about which,
I've been asked to speak tonight is the making,
of an investment banker.,
And I would start by saying investment banking is hard.,
It's also extraordinarily rewarding.,
It's fiercely competitive.,
"Most people in this room won't succeed as investment bankers,",
"or maybe not in this room, but in most rooms.",
"To most groups of people to whom I speak, most of them",
would not succeed in investment banking.,
"So I'm hopeful that tonight, the comments that I'm",
"going to make, the speech, the advice that I'm",
going to give you will help you increase,
"the chances of your success as an investment banker,",
if you choose to pursue a career in investment banking.,
I'm going to divide my talk into three parts.,
"Part one is the interview, getting the job.",
"Part two is keeping the job, how to succeed",
as a young analyst or associate investment banker.,
"And part three is excelling at the job,",
how to become an elite senior investment banker.,
"So part one, the interview.",
So all of you are at this incredibly competitive,
fantastic university.,
"All of you have great grades, hopefully.",
And you're all here tonight because you want to learn.,
You want to better yourselves.,
You want to improve your chances of getting a job in investment,
banking and of having a successful career in investment,
banking.,
"Those are all very, very, very good things.",
So I'm going to give you four pieces of advice,
"around the interview, which if you follow,",
will help you walk out of that interview with a job offer.,
Now I'm assuming that you will satisfy the basic requirements,
of an interview.,
So this list is not exhaustive.,
It's for things that you need to do,
on top of the basic requirements of an interview.,
And there are many.,
"| assuming, for example, that you",
have done research on the company for which you,
are interviewing.,
I'm assuming that you can project confidence,
in the interview.,
"I'm assuming you can walk someone, an interviewer,",
through your resume.,
I'm assuming those things and a host of other givens,
that I'm going to stipulate--,
that hopefully you've satisfied.,
"In addition to those, here are four pieces of advice",
I would give you.,
"Two things you should do prior to the interview, two things",
you should do in the interview.,
"Prior to the interview, all of you",
should be reading the Wall Street,
Journal every single day.,
"Read the Wall Street Journal every single day,",
three articles from the Wall Street Journal.,
One article on a macroeconomic topic,
like inflation or interest rates.,
"One article on a specific industry, company,",
or transaction.,
"So for example, a recent merger transaction",
that's been announced or a recent IPO,
that's been announced or a company that's recently,
announced earnings.,
It will be an article about whether those earnings are,
good or bad and why.,
One article on a specific company transaction.,
"And thirdly, an article from the Op-Ed page.",
Three articles every day no matter what.,
No exceptions.,
It'll take about 15 minutes a day.,
It's not hard.,
"If you do that, you'll be amazed at how you know,",
how much you've learned after six months or 12 months.,
You'll be amazed.,
You will know an incredible amount substantively,
after six months or a year.,
"You will also, by the way, begin to decipher the jargon",
"that we use as investment bankers, the jargon",
that we speak in.,
And that will help you in your interview and in your job.,
So read the Wall Street Journal.,
Start reading it early on.,
"Every day, three articles, 15 minutes.",
"Second thing you should do before the interview,",
become familiar with the three financial statements.,
Become familiar with the three financial statements.,
Know what they are.,
"If you don't now, that's OK.",
Look them up.,
"Ideally, take a class in financial accounting.",
And be facile with how these financial statements interact,
"with each other and be able to analyze them,",
at least at a basic level.,
Be familiar with the three financial statements.,
Two things you should do in the interview.,
"One, what topic do people enjoy talking about the most?",
Answer is--,
SPEAKER: Themselves.,
JIM DONOVAN: Very good.,
Themselves.,
"That may sound cynical, but that is a psychological fact.",
People enjoy most talking about themselves.,
"So in the interview, you want to get the interviewer",
to talk about himself or herself.,
That should be a primary goal.,
"You ask questions like, why did you decide",
to become an investment banker?,
Why did you decide to work at xyz firm?,
What's the most interesting transaction,
you worked on and why?,
Get the interviewer to talk about themself.,
"If you do that, they're going to enjoy the interview a lot more,",
which is good for you.,
"One, and two, by asking these personal questions,",
you will elicit the most authentic,
and genuine responses.,
You will learn the most.,
So get the interviewer to talk about himself or herself.,
"Secondly, you should do in the interview",
avoid questions that lend themselves to yes/no answers.,
"Ask questions that are open-ended,",
that require sentences as answers.,
"Ideally, multiple sentences as answers.",
"You want this interview to be a dialogue, not an interrogation.",
Ask open-ended questions.,
Those are the four things you should,
"do surrounding the interview, in addition to all of the basics",
that I'm assuming you've satisfied.,
"If you do those four things, you are",
"more likely to walk out of the interview with an offer, if you",
do them and you do them well.,
"Second part of the talk, keeping the job.",
How to succeed as a young analyst or a young associate,
in an investment bank?,
Six pieces of advice.,
"First piece of advice, find a role model.",
Find a role model.,
Your criteria for selecting the role model,
"is singular, purely merit-based.",
"You want to find the person who's an analyst, if that's",
"what you are, or an associate, if that's what you are,",
who's one or two years ahead of you and is the best at the job.,
You don't have to have a lot in common with them.,
You don't even have to like them.,
You want to find the person who's the best.,
And then you want to model your behavior at work,
after that person.,
"There's no reason to recreate the wheel, right?",
"If someone's doing the job very, very well",
"and it's generally recognized as being very, very good,",
"in fact, maybe the best, learn--",
watch that person.,
Study that person.,
"Learn as much as you can by watching them,",
and then model your behavior after them.,
"Second piece of advice, make it clear that you have no ego.",
Make it clear that you have no ego.,
Make it clear that you have no task that's given in to you--,
that there is no task that's given,
to you that is beneath you.,
There is no task too menial for you.,
Make it clear to the team that you're,
willing to do whatever is necessary for the team,
to succeed.,
"In fact, early on in your career as an analyst,",
"let's say in the first month or as an associate, volunteer",
for the menial tasks.,
Go get coffee.,
Make copies.,
Make it clear you have no ego.,
"Number three, take notes.",
Some of you are doing that tonight.,
Take notes.,
"When you're in a meeting with a client,",
"a prospective client, a superior, take notes.",
You want to do that because it conveys,
to the people in the room that you're serious.,
It also conveys to the people who,
are talking that what they're saying is important.,
You're writing it down.,
"And thirdly and most importantly, it",
gives them a sense of comfort that you're not,
going to forget what happened in the meeting or the follow-up,
task that you have to accomplish after the meeting.,
The analogy I always like to use with this,
is if you go to dinner with a group of your friends,
"and there's six of you at the table at a restaurant,",
and the waiter comes over and he takes your orders,
"and one at a time each of you order,",
and he doesn't write anything down.,
"And he says, terrific, I'll be back with your orders.",
And he leaves.,
"I don't know about you, but I'm wondering, in 30 minutes,",
am I going to get the salad that I ordered or am,
"I getting meatloaf, right?",
You've no idea because there's nothing written down.,
"It doesn't inspire confidence, and he didn't",
recap what the orders were.,
Now it may look impressive.,
"And I don't care if you have a photographic memory,",
take notes.,
Write things down.,
"And then in a meeting with your superior afterwards,",
walk through the list of follow-up items that you have.,
Tick them off.,
"Say to your boss, I will have the memo rewritten by tomorrow",
at noon.,
I'm going to rerun the model with the new numbers.,
The other follow-up item I have from the meeting,
is I'm supposed to call xyz person,
or write a text to abc person.,
Recap the meeting and your follow-up items with your boss.,
It will put your boss's mind at ease.,
"Even if you know them all, even if you're not",
"going to forget them all, it will",
"make your boss feel like, OK, it's OK.",
He's got this.,
She's got this.,
I don't need to worry about it.,
Take notes.,
"Number four, work hard.",
"Make no mistake, the most successful analysts",
and associates in investment banking,
are the hardest workers.,
Period.,
Full stop.,
"It doesn't matter if you're a good golfer,",
if you can schmooze well.,
Doesn't matter if you can play tennis well,
or you know something about professional sports.,
That doesn't matter.,
What matters is how hard are you willing to work.,
Be prepared for that.,
It's hard.,
Work hard.,
"Number five, related to number four.",
First impressions die hard.,
"Good first impressions die hard, and bad first impressions",
die hard.,
"So be very responsive, especially early on.",
There's nothing more frustrating for a senior investment banker,
than to send an email or a text to an analyst or an associate,
and have that email or text go unanswered,
for an extended period of time.,
"Don't let that happen, particularly early on.",
Be available.,
Be responsive.,
People like to extrapolate.,
"If the first five interactions they have with you,",
"you're super responsive, you never drop a ball,",
they're going to extrapolate from there,
and assume that behavior is going to continue.,
"If the first five interactions with you, you're unresponsive",
"and you forget a bunch of things,",
they're going to extrapolate in a negative direction.,
And it's incredibly hard to recover from that.,
First impressions die Hard.,
Make good ones.,
Be available.,
Be responsive.,
"Don't make mistakes, particularly early on.",
Number six piece of advice.,
"As a young associate or young analyst, never stop learning.",
"So in year two, day three, you should",
be reading the Wall Street Journal every day.,
"In year three, day four, you should",
be reading the Wall Street Journal every day.,
"Every day, you may read more articles.",
"You may read different articles, but read it every day.",
Ask questions of your peers.,
Ask questions of your superiors.,
Approach the second and third year the same way,
"you approach the interview, with that same zest, zeal,",
that same sense of intensity.,
Be curious.,
Ask questions.,
Never stop learning.,
The most successful analysts and associates do that.,
They never stop.,
They never rest on their laurels.,
"Third part of the presentation, how",
"to become an elite senior investment banker, how to",
really excel at this job.,
Six pieces of advice.,
"First, give your client advice that",
"is the best advice for the client, even if,",
"and in particular if, it is contrary to your own interests.",
There's no better way to establish credibility,
with a client than to give them advice that they know,
is contrary to your interest.,
Give that advice no matter what.,
"Second, take a position.",
Don't equivocate.,
The client has hired you to advise them.,
Tell them what to do.,
That's what they've hired you for.,
"Don't give them five options and say, pick one.",
"You pick one, advocate for it.",
"It's OK to present options, but advocate for one.",
Tell them what you would advise them to do.,
That's what they've hired you for.,
"Take a position, don't equivocate.",
"Number three, embrace and relish in adversity.",
"Adversity is what makes you better, stronger at this job.",
Relish it.,
"It's easy, particularly for young professionals, these days",
to want to take and to take shortcuts.,
It's easy in particular because we,
have phones and the internet.,
"And there's a lot of answers at our fingertips now, right?",
So if someone's asked you to build an Excel model to perform,
"some task at work, you could probably",
look up on the internet a model that will do that.,
Resist that temptation.,
Build your own model.,
Resist the temptation to take shortcuts.,
Live in the trenches because the best investment,
bankers lived in the trenches.,
Their skills were forge there.,
Relish adversity.,
You will come out of it stronger.,
"Don't be disappointed, afraid, angry when you encounter it.",
View it.,
Embrace it.,
And view it as something that will make you stronger.,
"Number four, master discipline.",
This job requires incredible discipline.,
"Master it, inside and outside of your work.",
This means different things to different people.,
"To some people, it means remaining physically fit.",
"To others, it means time management.",
Master discipline.,
Don't procrastinate.,
Don't let items build up in your inbox.,
Keep lists.,
Don't procrastinate.,
Be extraordinarily disciplined.,
Master it.,
"Number five, excel on the merits.",
"If you're really good at what you do,",
"if you're one of the best investment bankers,",
it's a lot easier to avoid spending time on things,
that you don't want to spend time on.,
And you'll have much more control,
over what you do at work and what you do outside of work.,
"A lot of people ask me, what's the best way",
to achieve work-life balance?,
"The answer is be really, really good at what you do.",
No one is going to give you a hard time,
"if you're the best investment banker at the firm,",
"or among the best, for taking some time off to do something",
that you like to do.,
"In fact, taking a lot of time off for doing something",
that you like to do.,
Excel on the merits.,
"Number six, final piece of advice.",
Never ever give up.,
Adopt that mantra as part of your life.,
Don't take no for an answer.,
"Apply this in everything you do, from getting reservations",
"at a restaurant, to getting a job, to getting a new client.",
"Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up.",
Don't take no for an answer.,
What separates the good investment bankers,
from the great investment bankers is the great investment,
bankers never ever give up,
imagine you're applying for a job you've,
passed successfully all examinations all,
assessments and tests you've been told,
by the examiner that you are the top,
scorer candidate that you have all,
analytical and soft skills to meet the,
jobs requirements you feel very happy,
because this job can change your life,
but the day before you should go to sign,
in the contract you receive a phone call,
the examiner tells you sorry,
but the director picked someone else he,
feels so sorry that he secretly shares,
with you that the selected person was a,
foolish candidate but was a close,
relative to the director has such a,
story happened to any one of you please,
let's do a show of hands how many about,
20% of the audience it's already,
something for those of you who,
experience that in the public sector,
I can imagine your feelings sadness,
anger even resignation this talk is,
about how to convert resignation into,
progress and eventually how to promote,
accountability of public sector leaders,
why the public sector is significant,
because all of us are paying taxes to,
fund it so we should all have the right,
to say something about the usage of the,
money,
and the amounted of taxes we pay is,
significant have a look to this map it,
represent the tax revenues in percent of,
the gross domestic product in 2015 the,
OECD average is at a third it means that,
about that that the tax revenues we pay,
represent a third of the value we create,
on average isn't it paradoxical that,
when we prepare a Christmas gift or when,
we want to change our phone subscription,
we spend hours even days comparing,
prices for some percent of difference,
whereas when we have to pay taxes we,
almost have nothing to say the taxes are,
used of course for the common good they,
are used to build schools roads to take,
care of the waste management or to pay,
police forces but it seems as with the,
discrimination in hiring example that,
some public leaders tends to forget,
about accountability to forget about the,
rules they may be themselves created and,
after all this kind of behavior begins,
to make the citizen less trustful in the,
public sector this lack of confidence,
creates the sign of a declining,
democracy and this we would not accept,
that we should change that and how can,
we do this that will be the purpose of,
this talk first we could contemplate,
having smart and honest people like you,
because you are interested in ideas,
worth spreading,
to access executive positions,
legislative positions to,
judicial position in our systems of,
course it will be already something very,
valuable but it will not be enough why,
because history has taught us that power,
tends to corrupt and absolute power,
corrupts absolutely,
and at the same time limitation is,
essential to Authority and a government,
is legitimate only if it is effectively,
limited so having smart people helps but,
it cannot be sufficient,
the second way I would like to address,
is how the public auditors can become an,
effective counter power public auditors,
can check real facts real figures,
provided by the government and in this,
way they can act as a counter power but,
only if they benefit from citizen,
support they can really be effective,
why citizen support is key citizen,
support is key because citizen have the,
power the power comes from you it has,
even been set in stone more than 200,
years ago in the Declaration of the,
Rights of Man and of the citizen,
established in 1789 this is a very,
important text for our civilization and,
within this text we can read that men,
are equal they have the same right to,
access public jobs and to take part in,
the legislative process,
France even created a stamp for the,
200th anniversary of this declaration,
here is the stamp and what I would like,
to highlight with you is the article 15,
which says that society has the right to,
require of every public agent,
on account of his administration so it's,
English words from 200 years ago,
basically it says that accountability,
should be the rule but what have we been,
doing with this right we have let's do a,
second show of hands how many of you,
have personally used this right to,
require accountability from your public,
authorities please raise hands maybe 10%,
of the audience,
it's already better than in the rear,
soles congratulations but still 10% is,
not the majority it seems we have like a,
broken link here between the citizen and,
the administration because we feel we,
cannot change things really we can only,
elect our government every four or five,
years and then wait and restart again,
and we don't have many possibilities to,
change things ongoing,
my belief is that this difficulty of,
communicating between the citizen and,
the admission and the administration can,
be improved through the use of the,
public auditors the public auditor would,
create two separate ways to improve the,
situation firstly with respect to the,
administration it will ask for increased,
transparency,
increased transparency means to,
constraint the administration to provide,
sound data to really give complete full,
and accurate figures public auditor can,
constraint the administration to set,
objectives that can be measured so that,
at the end of the term of a politician,
we can all note whether he succeeded or,
he failed but more importantly there is,
a second way the auditor can work on is,
the link and the connection with the,
citizen actually the link with you why,
this link is important let me show you,
an example from Geneva in 2013 on the,
website of the Court of Auditors,
we received a message mentioning some,
managers in that company are under high,
pressure to invest money into a project,
that makes no sense,
so although we are in Switzerland the,
plot the project is not about milk or,
cows it was about the windmills on the,
Jura mountains and after some,
investigations the court of Auditors,
could determine that some fraudulent,
practices were going,
going on because of a single employee of,
the company so the report was published,
and then a criminal claimed was filed,
and these are the press headlines,
so it's in French that were published,
after some time but you don't need to,
find huge cases like this to communicate,
with your auditors you can also,
communicate for some odd situations that,
you might face in your everyday life,
with the administration for instance,
when you go to do your car control check,
imagine you don't get to received as,
with the example of discrimination in,
hiring you if you are subject to such,
practice or imagine you are always the,
last on the queue when you require the,
right to have access to a subsidized,
apartment all of these can be,
investigated by a public auditor who,
will check the facts but for that the,
public auditor would need convention,
confidentiality and a special and secure,
channel with the citizen and this is a,
future crossroad for the public auditor,
is to give you enough confidence so that,
you feel free to contact him and what we,
we have now is that more and more some,
systems based on on web technology can,
guarantee of a very high encryption of,
the communication and the data will not,
even be hosted at the auditor place but,
in a secure system which is in another,
country and which is totally encrypted,
and secure,
here are an example of some public,
companies or big Federation's which have,
already set up such a secured channel so,
that citizens or users of these,
administrations can contact directly the,
public auditor bodies imagine as well,
that in other countries like in Brazil,
with lava jato like in Italy some years,
ago with manipulative in Germany with,
the Simmons case how faster the,
communication would have been if,
confidentiality could have been provided,
to the citizen last but not least make,
sure that accountability is not only,
valid for the public leaders but also,
for the public auditors you must control,
your auditors as well did I tell you I,
was working for the Geneva Court of,
Auditors make sure you're controlling me,
and if you come from other countries,
make sure that you can control your,
public auditors as well it's now time to,
conclude remember at the beginning I,
mentioned that accountability can change,
lives of people maybe with the case of,
the utility company investing in,
windmills this was a bit impersonal and,
you cannot really feel what happened in,
this case but imagine if I were to tell,
you that the discrimination in hiring,
example was not fictitious but it was,
real and indeed Court of Auditors made a,
note it some five years ago about hiring,
processes in Geneva administration and,
found a lot of problems and after the,
audit,
some processors were canceled some,
contracts were canceled and the process,
had to restart again so you can imagine,
that the person who was initially,
rejected but finally chosen could really,
have a change in his life as my final,
wish is to motivate you to communicate,
more with auditors when you have,
findings about fraudulent practices in,
the administration,
help me in Geneva I need you and help,
other public auditors wherever you come,
from communicate more with them they,
need you as well your communications can,
really bring more equal treatment about,
among citizen it can bring better value,
for the taxpayers and eventually it,
might increase the trust we have in our,
public authorities accountability was,
set in stone more than 200 years ago,
let's make it real now thanks to you,
Intro,
so now our first speaker is earl case,
ties with the topic the meaning of,
numbers in our line please welcome so if,
we're gonna change the world and we're,
gonna change ourselves and we're gonna,
talk about our minds we need to talk,
about numbers numbers are what influence,
us what control our behavior what make,
us think certain things numbers most,
important thing there is so if we're,
gonna start changing the world let's,
start with numbers you like numbers I,
can tell just by looking at you so let's,
talk about numbers,
think about a day in your life so think,
about yourself morning yourself this,
morning you're lying in bed you wake up,
should you get up or should you just,
stay there in bed what tells you whether,
you should get up or not a number you're,
gonna look at the clock by your bed or,
your phone or your watch and depending,
on that number,
maybe you're late the number will tell,
you maybe it's time to get up right now,
or maybe you can spend more minutes in,
bed how do you know you look at the,
number the very first thing you see in,
the morning is a number what time it is,
and that gets you up now if you're a,
curious person you're probably going to,
be on the internet pretty soon after you,
get up and if you're interested in the,
economy of Kazakhstan you're gonna go,
online and you're gonna look at two,
numbers you're gonna look at the price,
of oil and you're gonna look at the,
Kazakh Stan pinga exchange rate this,
morning by the way if you didn't look,
the price of oil is 37 dollars a barrel,
for Brent crude oil the exchange rate,
between the tenge and the US dollar 343,
those two numbers 37 and 343 tell us,
about millions of economic interactions,
that took place during the night while,
you were asleep just reflected in those,
two numbers all right now it's time to,
leave your house when I leave my,
apartment building I go out on the,
street sometimes I take the bus to come,
here to the University but how do I know,
which bus to get on there are lots of,
buses going back and forth I just look,
at the number if the bus is 40 on the,
front I get on that bus and I come here,
to campus the number tells me now I get,
here to campus let's see I had a very,
difficult exam last week I understood,
some of the material but some of the,
material I'm afraid I didn't master how,
well did I do how well did I understand,
the material will I get my exam paper,
back today and it says 82 that one,
number summarizes my understanding of,
that material and also we see that,
numbers are often involved with,
controversy was it a fair exam does that,
82 really reflect how well I did on the,
exam what was the process used in,
generating that 82 numbers are often in,
the middle of controversy now many of my,
friends have had influenza recently am I,
also sick how can I tell what it's a,
very quick way to tell if I'm sick or,
not a number I measure my body,
temperature and if it says 37 I'm okay,
don't worry but if I measure my body,
temperature and it says 40 I'm sick I,
need to go to the doctor and now it's,
nighttime you go home you've worked hard,
all day you're feeling a little tired,
should you lie down and go to sleep,
how do you know you look at the number,
you woke up with a number you go to,
sleep with a number and numbers have,
been influencing your behavior all day,
long our bodies our minds are controlled,
to some degree by the numbers that we,
see every day numbers are how we changed,
the world now there's a Nobel,
Bounded rationality,
prize-winning economist named Herbert,
Simon and he said this and I'm gonna,
read this bounded rationality the term,
bounded rationality is used to designate,
rational choices that takes the account,
the cognitive limitations of both,
knowledge and cognitive capacity in,
other words our brains are not big,
enough to have all the data of,
everything in the world right in our,
brains and even if the data were in,
there we wouldn't have the capacity to,
process them so we need to simplify our,
world we use numbers to simplify our,
world this next person is not a Nobel,
Prize winning economist it's me but I,
also have some thoughts on this the,
objective of the fields of Statistics in,
the county is to reflect the essence of,
a complex situation in one number and it,
helps us navigate our way in this,
complex world now this goes a little,
stronger perception influences action,
accounting and numbers determine,
perception therefore accounting rules,
the world you've often wondered in life,
but who's running things around here,
what is ruling the world it's accounting,
and numbers rule the world now you know,
it's not President Putin it,
not even present another buy of its,
numbers and accounting that ruled the,
world so here's my agenda I'm going to,
tell you how a numbers can be very,
influential in our society in business,
which is my specialty and also in our,
personal lives so let's get started how,
old is this use of numbers in making,
decisions how old is a county well it's,
"really old it's over 7,000 years old in",
fact numbers are older than writing,
accounting is older than writing think,
Numbers are older than writing,
of those first farmers in Mesopotamia,
"7,000 years ago had some sheep do I have",
more sheep this year than I had last,
year well I don't know I can count them,
but I can't remember how many I had last,
year so I don't know but somebody had,
the great idea I'm gonna count my sheep,
42 and I'm gonna mark it down on the,
wall and next year one year from now,
when it's the same season I'll count my,
sheep again and there are 45 and I look,
on the wall I say that's more than I had,
last year my number of sheep went up and,
the words gonna go around the village,
his number of sheep went up what did he,
do what's his secret all of a sudden we,
start to be able to use numbers to,
change the way we behave in society,
because we write them down the first,
writing was accounting and numbers so,
all the books that you read realized,
that numbers and accounting came before,
those books it's the foundation of our,
civilization numbers ladies and,
gentlemen all right this summer the,
world's going to go to Rio de Janeiro,
for the Summer Olympics and one of the,
premier events in the Summer Olympics is,
a 100-meter dash the women and the men,
the current world's record for women in,
Why are women catching up,
the 100-meter dash is ten point four,
nine seconds for men it's nine point,
five eight seconds you're saying bolt,
we're gonna see if he can win the third,
time in a row of this this summer 95,
years ago the record for the hundred,
meter dash for women was thirteen point,
six seconds and for men it was ten point,
four seconds the gap is what I want you,
to think about between women and men was,
3.2 seconds 95 years ago now it's less,
than one second well what's happened why,
are women catching up where why are,
women catching up so fast,
is it evolution our women's bodies,
evolving much faster than men's no,
there's no biological evolution that,
explains that it's the evolution of our,
society women no longer have to deal,
with the,
areas that they had to deal with 95,
years ago 95 years ago women had a,
mental barrier dive should I run should,
I train I don't think I can do it,
Society would tell women that they,
couldn't do it but those barriers have,
been broken down in the last 95 years,
women have been catching up with men,
here in in many other ways and that big,
change in our society is summarized in,
four numbers numbers tell us a lot about,
a lot of things now let's imagine that,
there's a young woman named Lilly we'll,
talk about business now she wants to,
start her dream is to have an ice cream,
factory in fact she's decided she wants,
to build it in this very room she's,
gonna make beautiful chocolate vanilla,
ice cream and other terrible flavors,
chocolate and vanilla are the best or,
she's gonna make an ice cream factory,
right here what's standing between her,
dream of a chocolate or of an ice cream,
factory and the actual factory itself,
it's just a hundred million US dollars,
to buy the property and to put the,
machines in 100 million US dollars on,
where's she gonna get that hundred,
million u.s. dollars think about was you,
where would you get a hundred million US,
dollars well maybe your personal savings,
but most of us would come up a little,
short of the hundred million dollars our,
friends and family are neighbors but,
that's still not gonna be enough we're,
gonna have to get the money from,
strangers from big groups of banks from,
private investors maybe we'll have to,
take our company public and sell shares,
of our company to people who live in,
Zimbabwe and Finland and in Australia,
strange places that we'll never see how,
how can we convince strangers to give us,
a hundred million dollars to turn our,
dream of an ice cream factory into,
reality it's numbers numbers are going,
to do that without reliable financial,
reports the dreams of people who want to,
start companies entrepreneurs we call,
them can never become reality those,
numbers those accounting reports are,
what convert dreams into reality very,
very influential it's what makes our,
economy happen okay I just while I'm,
Tax rates,
here talking about business here are two,
numbers tax rates for two companies of,
which you've heard I'm sure Microsoft,
and ExxonMobil Microsoft's tax rate is,
19.2% Exxon Mobil's tax rate 38.4,
percent quite a bit different but,
they're both based in the United States,
and I happen to know that the national,
tax rate for corporations in the United,
States is 35 percent so how is Microsoft,
paying such a low tax rate now if this,
were an accounting class I now have you,
break up into groups and we generate,
ideas about why this is I'm just gonna,
tell you,
Microsoft is run by smart people and,
they say in their financial reports that,
their operations are located in,
Singapore and Puerto Rico and Ireland,
now why would they choose Singapore and,
Puerto Rico and Ireland because the tax,
rates are low there and if they can,
generate most of their income in those,
low tax places they pay an on average,
lower tax rate why does an ExxonMobil do,
the same thing because their operations,
are determined by where the oil is and,
in just these two numbers we see,
something important about our modern,
economy intellectual property can be,
moved around Microsoft's operations are,
based on intellectual property and that,
intellectual property is gonna find,
where low tax rates are the,
old-fashioned businesses like ExxonMobil,
are stuck where they are and so they,
have to pay the high tax rates and,
governments are frustrated with this,
around the world because the Microsoft's,
and the apples and the Google's can move,
their valuable economic assets,
intellectual property around to pay,
lower tax rates and that very,
interesting economic development is,
summarized in two numbers numbers tell,
us so much about the world that we live,
Two numbers,
in now we can also use numbers to get,
people to do what we want them to do I'm,
a father I'm often trying to get people,
to do what I want them to do so I'll,
tell you see the microphone went out for,
a second when I said two sons because,
it's a lot of trouble to son five,
daughters that's a very good number but,
let me tell you about my two sons in,
1995 my family moved to Hong Kong my,
sons were in middle school I went with,
them to the first day of their school,
and the principal of the school was,
telling about the great academic,
programs the school had is very very,
interesting until she happened to,
mention if your children want to ride,
the the private school bus to school it,
will cost them seven US dollars a day,
each,
she continued in talking about the,
academic programs of the school but I,
didn't pay any attention to that because,
now I'm thinking about that number seven,
seven for him and seven for him I knew,
that they could ride to school for one,
u.s. dollar a piece with public,
transportation we just done it to get to,
the school so our family,
could save six US dollars a day each if,
if I could just somehow convince them to,
take public transportation rather than,
this school bus so I'm saying I'm not,
listening to the principal anymore but I,
came up with a plan after she was done,
with their discussion I said to my son's,
come with me I need to talk to you about,
something we went out in the field,
behind their school I explained these,
numbers to them and explained that our,
family could save six dollars a day if,
they would only take public,
transportation they weren't really that,
interested until I said this I'll split,
the savings with you if you'll take the,
Public transportation,
public transportation,
I will here's the number that I put in,
their minds three dollars a day I will,
pay you three dollars a day to ride,
public transportation now do you think,
that I ever had to talk to my sons again,
about taking public transportation to,
school no never a word every Friday they,
would come to me and they just hold out,
their hands fifteen US dollars to son,
number one fifteen US dollars to some,
number son number two that measurement,
of three that's what I would pay them,
each day if they would take public,
transportation that solved our problem I,
could have I could have told them,
everyday about the savings for our,
family and the good of our family in a,
week great for our family if they take,
public transportation not interested but,
that number three that change their,
attitude perfectly we only had one,
problem with this in the fall of their,
first year they had a holiday they,
didn't go to school on Monday and,
Tuesday they only went Wednesday,
Thursday Friday so they came to me on,
Friday they held out their hand I only,
gave them nine dollars each they said,
that is $15 I said and there's a holiday,
you only getting you only get you only,
went to school three days after that,
they bitterly complained every time,
there was a school holiday that they,
they hated the Christmas holiday season,
it cost some money do you think they,
were ever sick and stayed home from,
school they had to have bubonic plague,
or they would stay home from school,
because of the simple number three I pay,
them three dollars a day it changed,
their behavior so remember you get what,
you measure if I want if I want them to,
take public transportation I have to,
measure correctly at that number of ways,
heavily in their minds I use it on,
Balance scorecard,
myself,
there's certain things that I want to do,
each day so I have a little card in,
accounting we call us at balanced,
scorecard I I write down nine numbers,
every day I'm not going to tell you all,
of them because some of them are kind of,
personal but I'll tell you about three,
of them first I weigh myself every,
morning I write it down right here I'm,
not going to tell you how much I weigh,
but I know how much I weigh because I,
write it down every morning and it,
changes my behavior all day I'll see,
some donuts sitting there Oh should I,
eat those donuts if I eat that doughnut,
it's gonna pay me back tomorrow morning,
when I step on that scale it controls my,
behavior or influences my behavior all,
day just that number just the fact that,
I weigh myself each day a couple of,
things that I measure each they are just,
zero or one,
did I exercise or not zero one did I,
read with my daughter's I have two,
daughters who are 14 years old and I,
long ago decided it's important that I,
read with them every day so every day if,
I read with them I put down a 1 if I,
don't read with them I put down the zero,
the things are important in my life I,
measure with numbers and it's summarized,
on this little card my balanced,
scorecard numbers can influence and,
guide and control our lives they,
influence and guide and control our,
society business but also in our,
personal life it's a very powerful tool,
a number I use numbers to help me do the,
things that I want to do it makes my,
life better and numbers can make your,
lives better as well thank you very much,
you,
Introduction,
sitting in your pocket right now is the,
mobile phone almost a hundred percent of,
you on that phone you can download any,
dozens of applications that will let you,
put your voice on it and project your,
voice to the whole world it'll involve,
you in as many conversations as you want,
I wanted to do that but I'm gonna count,
it and I used to be a banker and that's,
not what we do we don't put ourselves in,
public situations we belong behind logos,
of big corporates in tall buildings in,
the city we hide behind superannuation,
ads and we hide behind complicated,
spreadsheets that we deliberately,
designed to make sure you have no idea,
what we're doing we're very good at it,
you might hear from us once or twice a,
year and if your accountants really,
innovative you'll get a monthly,
newsletter talking to you about the,
exciting changes to taxation as,
accountants you don't realize but we're,
Why listen to your accountant,
the brunt of your jokes and we know it,
because you don't hang out with us at,
your family barbecues you put us at the,
end of the table while the good chat,
happens at the other end and then,
sometimes you come and talk to us when,
you want free advice about your next,
investment property or if you want to,
find out if that family trip to Bali is,
tax deductible which it isn't but check,
with your accountant don't take my word,
for it,
US accountants are so unheard of that,
when you jump on ted.com and you,
actually search for accountants you get,
a talk from a guy who survived a shark,
attack Utah searched for a barista comes,
up with a search from a barista that,
makes sense and that tells us something,
that tells us that you value being,
caffeinated more than staying out of,
jail more than not losing your family,
home and more than not realizing your,
financial hopes and dreams you know,
sometimes I get in an uber and,
everyone's been in this situation you,
can tell that the uber driver is a,
little bit chatty and you're not,
interested you've got to get to the,
family barbecue,
well that chat usually starts with the,
driver asking you one simple question,
what do you do now I've got a trick up,
my sleeve,
a car myself I lower my voice and whilst,
exhaling I say I'm an accountant and,
it's peace it's bliss there is no,
chatter because not even the guy I'm,
paying to be in close proximity with me,
is interested what I do 9:00 to 5:00,
Monday to Friday and Monday to Sunday,
during tax season but let's just say I,
get to that family barbecue one time and,
everything is going well let's say ten,
of us do it a studies showing the four,
of you won't talk to anyone about your,
financial hopes and dreams no one two,
and a half of you will talk to your,
business partner one and a half will,
talk to a family or a friend and just,
one will talk to me and I'm just,
grateful I got the invitation in the,
first place but here's the crazy bit,
that same study found if you talk to,
your business partner you have a 50/50,
The coin flip,
chance of getting positive advice that,
you can execute that's a coin flip a guy,
you've been in business with for 10 20,
years if you talk to a friend you have,
just a 25% chance of getting positive,
advice but if you come and talk to me I,
have an 83% chance of giving you,
positive advice that's a massive,
increase but it doesn't happen so why,
aren't accountants involved in all these,
great public conversations right now on,
Twitter a guy who started and failed,
five businesses is dishing out business,
advice 280 characters at a time,
to thousands of would-be entrepreneurs,
unchecked and since I started talking,
"1,250 hours of video has been uploaded",
on YouTube how much do you think was,
from accountants part of this is our,
fault because our great unknown is,
putting ourselves out there and the,
The great unknown,
great unknown for all of us is scary and,
us accountants you like us because we,
don't take risks that's not what we do,
so what are we gonna do about it well I,
wanted to have my voice heard I want to,
be involved in these conversation so I,
started in a safe place I started a,
podcast for accountants,
"it's now distributed to 30,000",
accountants every week and part of it is,
in part of the reason it's doing so as,
because of it I became a finalist as an,
accounting thought leader of a year and,
an accounting awards night so clearly,
here ice accountants like talking to,
ourselves but that's not what I want to,
do I want to go out and help communities,
so I had to change I realized I couldn't,
talk call myself an accountant so what,
did I do,
I spent money on consultants Social,
Media Consultants Media Consultants,
branding consultants and I found out,
that I wasn't just an accountant I was a,
financial mentor my journey throughout,
Financial mentor,
this whole thing started at the National,
Australia Bank eight years ago I joined,
their social selling program how do you,
think banks social selling program went,
banks don't like bankers having public,
opinions about banking it got shut down,
quicker than it started it was scary for,
me because I tried and now my podcast,
was doing well I needed to do more so I,
got with these consultants and we,
realized as a financial mentor and what,
does that mean well as a financial,
mentor my job is to walk with you with,
your great unknown and as a mentor if I,
do my job really well I'll find your,
opportunities and I'll help you realize,
them and I'll find your vulnerabilities,
and I'll help you manage those and if I,
get involved in your community I'll have,
a tangible manageable impact and that's,
what I want to do and if throughout that,
journey you find opportunity for me or,
if throughout that journey you find my,
vulnerabilities then I'll be successful,
because we've just created a community,
just amongst the two of us so next time,
you have that big idea well next time,
you have that small idea next time you,
want to do something go talk to your,
accountants and get a financial mentor,
thank you,
