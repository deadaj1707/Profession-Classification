I know we made a good piece of Television like I know that and I know it wasn't because of the budget it was,
because of the story it was because of the heart it was because of of the commitment to it and so you don't need,
to make a movie for $670 million for it to be good I know that for a fact and,
and a lot of us come from that that truth thank you hey welcome to offs,
script with The Hollywood Reporter I am your host Ivan orgy here at the Georgian Hotel hotel in Santa Monica California,
today we are serving up some hot takes with six aess actors from some of this year's award contending,
films you're about to hear from Coleman Domingo of Rustin Robert Downey Jr of,
Oppenheimer Paul Giamatti of the holdovers Mark Ruffalo of poor things,
Andrew Scott of all of us strangers and Jeffrey Wright of American,
fiction they are on the record but just little off script with The Hollywood,
Reporter over to you Scott thank you Ivon it is truly a pleasure to have with,
us these six actors who did such outstanding work in 2023 films and I want to begin by establishing the fact,
that there are a lot of connections at this table some of which the general public is well aware of some of which,
even you guys yourselves may not know because these started early in your career so I'm going to just mention a,
few movies and if the people people who were part of these hear stuff I don't want to,
hear 1998 25 years ago Mark Ruffo and Paul Gatti you were both in safeen do we have,
any memories of that nice stash bro that's it that's the best the movie,
there you go now that same year 25 years ago Paul Giamatti and Andrew you Andrew,
Scott were both in Saving Private Ryan how is that even possible yeah I was the guy in,
green I loved him nice work oh [ __ ] I didn't even know,
I didn't know that either because we were together subsequently 10 years after that the,
same two gentlemen John Adams sure John Adams I was the guy in the powdered way that's now Mark Ruffo and Jeffrey Wright,
almost 25 years ago angle Ride With the Devil any memories of of that that true story yes I lied about being able to,
ride a horse I remember I remember very vividly walking past you you were tied to a,
fence post if I'm not mistaken that's right Beautiful Beginning I Remember Now Paul you and,
Coleman Domingo in 2013 all is bright oh yes yes legendary all is,
bright that old CH that really yeah wow it's a Christmas movie it's very dark,
yeah now Paul and Jeffrey dark Christmas movie both in Lady in the Water 2006 and,
the eyes of March 2011 wow so there may be some uh memories there,
everything okay you're like the American Michael Kan can you speak to that now Robert and,
Mark here at the end of the table it started with 2007's zodiac and then,
there was a whole bunch of movies slow uh company called Marvel I believe you guys were together were you in that oh,
wow yes after I convinced you that's true though right you were lobbying for,
Mark to do it I wouldn't be here today without you really in so many ways and,
finally I will note that this year not only uh is Coleman Domingo terrific in,
rusting but so is Jeffrey right so there's two right up through the present it's our first time working together,
that's crazy really yeah so you're not only here because of your great work but you're also here of your great work in,
the project he's I'm just following,
Coleman's got two two going now we're going to get into these 2023,
performances of each of you but um I want to First go back and ask each of you about sort of a a pivotal Turning,
Point a decision in your career that maybe laid the groundwork for the uh eventually having a year like you had in,
2023 and Robert maybe we can start with you your late father who you made this,
wonderful uh documentary senior both with and about he was a pillar of the indie film Community you started out,
very much in the Indie art housee uh scene but there was this moment when,
you're approached by Marvel about Iron Man because of your background in indie film did you have any hesitation about,
taking them up on that so my dad raised me in this environment of to be growing,
up was to be making movies and then doing this documentary about him and,
then my Mrs who produced it with Chris Smith having the tenacity to tell me that I had to follow through with it and,
not try to do a puff piece at all because our our history was so complicated that was really a big,
turning point and then shortly after that Nolan called so you never know what happens when you realize if you deal,
with the things in your life that are so small but so important it kind of opens gateways for the stuff that we think as,
important you know or maybe perceived as important you've said and I'm going to quote quote back to you I was raised in,
a that rebelled against the idea of a summer blockbuster having any Merit I'm happy that I regained my connection with,
a more purist approach to making movies most recently with with Oppenheimer but before I mean just this idea of stepping,
into that world was it jarring no because anyone who knows John favro knows that he is I mean I remember,
seeing swingers and just that monologue he has and I was like and he wrote this I was like who is this guy because there,
was no real assurity that this was even going to take off Iron Man was like second tier hero they kind of let the,
lunatics run the Asylum for a little while and we so it was a completely an indie approach to a a genre movie to,
begin with but I've seen that in all the films this year there's this thing happening I would say particularly this,
year where I feel like many of us are afforded this opportunity to kind of like there's a little subversion within,
the accessibility that I so appreciate Coleman let's go back if we can to I,
believe 2005 you're in newor York away from where your family was based friends,
I think you're bartending struggling to find acting work and you decide to sort of take matters into your own hands,
right what can you tell us about oh wow this onean show that really sort of turned things around man I well I was a,
a bartender at a bar in the West Village called the 55 bar I would do whatever,
play that I can do and then run across town and finish my start my shift at 9:00 and go until 4:00 in the morning,
and then when I wasn't working I was writing and I was trying to create something for myself because you know,
just you just a frustrated artist and um between like when things when things would clear out about 1:00 in the,
morning I was writing and I was putting on music and I was sort of writing about what was happening in my life both my parents were suffering from different,
illnesses and they lived in uh Virginia and I was just you know still just trying to you know figure things out I,
lived in a terrible situation illegal sublet and everything so I was just you know hustling New York story it's such a,
New York story oh yeah so I started writing and I started writing what was going on and about the music I was,
putting on I I really still can't to this day remember if stories came first or the song came first but I was putting,
this thing together that eventually I I'm one of those people like if you give me a space I will figure out something,
to do so the owner said um hey Coleman I want to do some theater some projects on Sundays you have anything I'm like yeah,
let me try this stuff out so I would do weird things like serve fried chicken and put on music and it's weird I would,
make it like sort of like a salon and then I would I would read these pieces and so I read them and then friends of,
mine was say I think what is it I'm like is it a play what they're like I think it's a solo show you're the event and you have to follow this through I,
started working with that and I worked with the director and it became a show called a boy in a soul when it started,
out it was about like how music was helping me to find different moments and anchor me in certain things and part of,
sort of keeping your records keeping your soul your song music then eventually my parents passed away they,
passed away while I was finishing this uh they both passed six months apart and the show was the thing that became the,
gift that kept on giving I found I found my voice I feel like as a as a writer and I started perform performed at the,
vineyard theater in New York and and in London and in Australia and it really gave me more grounding of like who I was,
and what I could do and so I really created this thing where I played my family members myself and all that and,
and it felt like it's something that I wanted to be in conversation with with audiences like how how do we do it how,
do we move through grief how do we build when there's nothing but it really I don't know then I was solidifi as a,
playwright in New York and um people started to see me as the artist that I was because I've always been a character,
actor and so I would play seven characters literally at one time so so so that was fun and wonderful and it,
really gave me some new footing for my career um and then it's the thing that I think is the greatest gift that I,
learned from that is to create something uh not only for myself but for others so if like it gave me more agency in this,
industry and you you worked at the 55 bar yeah we we we might have done some work together prior to ruson and I spent,
a lot of time at the 55 I was bartending there I was there for for four years lot of good music there a lot of great music,
there yeah Andrew the math doesn't add up because I don't know how it's possible you're making movies 25 years,
ago you look so uh youthful great yeah I,
came but I think it makes the it hammers home the point like this is I think there certain people who flipped on,
season 2 of flea bag and it became this phenomenon the the hot priest and they,
thought this is like a a new guy uh you'd been doing this for a while and I wonder when that moment happened where,
suddenly there's unprecedented levels of interest in you how did you handle it personally and then also in terms of,
choices because you could have uh probably done more things than ever before in that moment how did you decide,
what to do I don't know I've always found like I started out really young I was 17 or 18 when I was at the ABY the,
National Theater in Dublin and I don't whatever it was when I was very young I remember being offered a,
part after I'd done maybe two plays and I was only a little skit of a thing and,
I was like I don't really want to do that and I was I think I was still living at home so maybe I felt like I,
don't want to do that again and quite early on I suppose this word is courage go I don't want to just play the same,
note if I don't have to because it always seemed to me that what's of value to you is to be able to play as many different kind of notes as as as you,
could and so all the time where I wasn't sort of more what's the word I suppose,
recognizable I never felt like I was failing really I was always just so delighted to be to be working,
and then I suppose when you get a bit more choice I never really think that I was I'm kind of was winning or you know,
wasn't really that particularly different except I do think there's a kind of thing that I think a lot of,
actors have which is a sort of quiet thing where you I love that thing that that Merill Street says and she's a,
Great Hero Of Mine which is to sort of pack your own suitcase you know that even if you're not getting the,
opportunities that you decide what you're going to put in your suitcase and even if someone isn't asking you to go,
on holidays you got your little bag you got it there and you go and so when some an,
opportunity comes up you go I recognize them I've packed for that slightly and and I think I think I think it's it's a,
kind of it's a beautiful thing isn't it and and uh and I I suppose then you just have a thing inside and you just go I don't want to do the same thing again,
and that's it is it's a cliche but I do think that's our biggest power is we to say no I'm just not going to do that,
again for those for the wrong for the wrong reasons so it was beautiful don't get me wrong but I don't know to try and,
keep it keep it keep it level Paul long before American Splendor sideways,
Cinderella Man John Adams private life billions all the stuff that you know many people know and love you for you're,
a a guy recently out of the ale School of drama you've done from Broadway and then the film,
opportunities you were making the most of them but I don't imagine that at the,
beginning the dream was if I may just remind uh Pig vomit in private parts or,
an orangutan in uh in the Planet of the Apes when for you oh that was a dream,
that was a no that was that was a that was the strange fulfillment of a deep dream seriously to be an orangutang to,
be an ape and Planet of the Apes it was was if that had been it for me I would,
be I would die happy well this is where I could believe I was going to be able to play a talking arang T and my agents,
were like don't you want to be a human so they can see your face and I was like if you tell them I want to be a human,
I'm going to burn the agency I was like who wants to be the,
human in Planet of the no that was a huge like you know and then what was the,
role that was in your mind kind of the the thing that I'm sure maybe you had,
something like it in your mind when you're going through the training that I've just talked about I actually think,
I mean you say pig vomit and you laugh but it's like I that was such a,
crazy being fired out of the craziest cannon in the world it was I couldn't,
believe I was being allowed off the chain like that you know I just been in a drama school where it was like I was,
it was very confining and and it always felt terrible confining I mean look at me man I'm not like a Shakespeare guy,
and stuff like that I I tried but I I felt very confined a lot of the time and,
I got out and I got this opportunity to do something it was absolutely bananas,
and it was like there was no top on the thing it was it spoiled me in a lot of ways because I thought oh this is what,
this is like doing a movie is can actually be like because Betty Thomas I mean we rehearsed a lot she was,
incredibly caring it was like the camera guys were wonderful Howard stern was,
great I mean he was lovely and it was like and I got to do the dumbest accent,
in the world and like there was nothing I could just go bananas so I felt really,
freed coming out of something and I just it felt theatrical too she made all,
literal space so you could just get Huger and Huger and crazier and crazier and it was just fantastic wow yeah well,
Jeffrey uh you start out really uh on most people's radar probably with Angel,
in America winning Tony for that on Broadway you come out with basat in your,
first film role and within about 5 years though you have said that your attitude towards basically the business if we can,
generalize really had changed and your priorities the things that you were,
interested in doing as an actor as a person totally got upended can you just explain cuz it does seem from the way,
you've talked about it that there was a before and after what happened this is what I've learned and we spoke about this a little earlier,
this is the thing that I have come to Value above all other things in in this,
stuff that we do and it's the collaboration it's the people that that I have the opportunity to do it with I,
learned that because early on there were some collaborations that uh you know,
might have been uh uh better diplomacy,
throughout and it's you it comes with u you know with the territory in terms of the lessons that you're you know you're,
required to learn and eventually you get through it but yeah there were some you know where I'd walk into a place and go,
yeah o this is not my beautiful house you know this is not what I expected you know when you talked about being in this,
environment that was supportive and that was creative and spontaneous and that it was like I found myself a couple of,
times in some really what I thought were very cynical places and I think the way that I kind of um was able to articulate,
it at the time was that these were places that rooms that aspired to be,
dumber than what was possible within the room and I was like oh wow man this is,
kind of weird um yeah kind of pulled back but also there were other priorities and other considerations that,
you make in terms of what you want to do like you know oh wow there's a human being that was just born into my life,
you know and a lot of work in Africa uh there was a lot of work that I yeah that was a part of you know let me you know,
it kind of Drew Me In I was trying to find something else that was um I had interests going back to you know college,
in um in in in issues that were related to the work that we were doing and so I kind of got drawn in and and it but it,
felt very creative at the same time in fact the first time that I went to Africa though speaking of grounding which is kind of related to what we're,
doing here was when I went to the Venice Film Festival um with bosot in 96 and I,
was like oh man okay this is all this stuff and you know this here's the here we guys said so I said to uh I said to,
the producer at the time I said okay fly me to Sagal fly me to dhar cuz I've never been to Africa I've never been to,
Europe before so fly me to darar and I'll meet you in Venice in a week you know so that that place was always there,
I kind of wanted to like kind of invade Europe like a Moore or something like that so there was always that you know there was always that Temptation and I,
think maybe always a bit of the suspicion of you know some of the the trappings of what we do you know um it's,
a much simpler thing at its core but it's surrounded by things that sometimes are not so simple mark it sounds like,
you had your own period of kind of questioning things around 08 09 2010,
where as you put it you pretty much had had it with acting and shed a lot of the,
things that agents and representatives of All Sorts what was going on that made,
you step away and then what made you I think with the kids are all right come back,
in relation to what um Jeffrey was talking about was you know there's you have your dreams um of it and then those,
start to become realized but they're not what you thought it was going to be at some point you know it gets away from,
you and next thing you realize is like you're it's the all about the business and someone's idea someone else's idea,
of your career that really didn't have much to do with what your idea idea was,
and then you lose what your idea was of what your career was going to be and I,
was already feeling that way and then my brother passed away and I uh it passed away just before,
I was going to direct a film um that I've been working on for a long time and,
during the course of that I was like I don't know if I want to go back to acting I kind of feel more much more,
comfortable here in this place you know just the the WTH of creativity that,
opened up to you as a director you're working with all the you know the department heads you're working with,
music you're working with movement you're working with the camera you're it was just it was like a feast of um,
creativity I got a great part the kind of part of movie that I I wanted to do,
and I was like this is going to be my last acting gig and it was the kids are all right and I was just like [ __ ] it,
I'm going to do whatever I want here I I'm I don't there's no rules anymore more I don't have to be anybody for,
anybody else and so I just kind of just did what I wanted with it and it was,
really freeing feeling and we went to Sundance and I had my the movie I directed premiered and then two days,
later the kids are all right premiered and I was sitting in that,
audience and I was like this experience is so honest this movie is,
about something so important at a coming into the world at a moment you know about gay marriage when all of these,
people were voting on gay marriage and it was saying you know we're the same and and there's no difference between,
straight marriages and gay marriages and it did it in a funny way that was just a human story that people could all relate,
to and I heard it in the laughter like the laughter tells you everything you know the laughter and the silence right,
and I heard everyone laughing whether they were straight or gay or whatever the religion was their,
background everyone were all laughing at the same thing and I was like that's what I want to do that's that's why I,
came here and then no one was like hey do you want to make another movie you want a five picture movie deal as a,
director and so I like um I oh I found my way oh there's a there's a little a,
little glimmer of a the path go there go there young man go,
there and that was kind of yeah having talked a little bit about the foundations that may have uh somewhat,
shaped the the decisions regarding these 2023 performances let's get into those,
and Jeffrey you work very selectively which is a that's a great thing and so I,
wonder though here's a guy CT Jefferson who's a terrific TV writer succession,
the good place one and Emy for Watchmen who says he wants to make his feature,
directorial debut how does a firsttime filmmaker convince you to sign up to,
collaborate with him in this case to play uh a college professor who has been,
told that the reasons his books are not selling is because they are not quote unquote black enough and then decides to,
try to write one that is I believe the book that is based on persal ever Sera,
talks with this idea about him the narrator hating WR hating stories that are about writers as he writes the story,
cord had taken that book and adapted it into this script that he gave me and uh,
yes uh uh you know it's a story about a writer it's a story about someone who uh,
does all of those things you you said but it was first it was like really just,
beautifully drawn the architecture was like so sharp you know it was clear that cord knew his way around a story but,
what really drew me in wasn't like kind of that like for me first level stuff I,
mean it's glittering it's it's it's satirical it's great for me it was the the story of this man,
who's all of a sudden burdened with the responsibilities of family I mean you guys have talked about you know how,
these things affect my mom passed not too sure not too long before I got that,
script and so it was uh you know the caretaking yeah of the one who was once,
caretaker that for me was what the story um how the story resonated that's what,
like plucked me I said I know that story I know that man and I know the difficulties and the sacrifices that,
that asks not only like creatively professionally but also personally and,
you know I can play that music and may you know maybe it'll be helpful to me,
and maybe and maybe uh you know someone else I don't know but um yeah it's not,
all the you know it's not it was just that and also I think in some ways that that is the most subversive aspect of,
the film because it really is a portrait that I'd never been asked to play Within,
before a portrait of a goofy mad you know dysfunctional at times,
functional loving frustrated but together family that happens to be black,
it's you know it's a family that's what that really is what the neon is pointing,
to that's the meal for me so you know yeah it was easy to say yes,
to that nice uh Paul it's been 19 years since you and Alexander Payne made the,
terrific movie Sideways I know there had been conversations about maybe doing other things over the intervening years,
but here we are he comes to you with the holdovers in which you're playing this,
boarding school teacher cranky guy who is made further cranky by having to,
spend the holiday break with a a grieving cafeteria worker and a and a,
grieved student was the fact that it was Alexander coming back uh and asking you,
to do this enough or did was there something um particularly about this character where you said I'm,
particularly gungho to do this well yeah I mean him coming back and saying I want to work again was pretty good I mean I,
would have done pretty much anything for the guy but he was showing me this script as it was coming along and he,
said you know I'm writing this thing for you and I kept saying he smells like fish he's got sweaty Palms he's got a,
crazy eye you know and all of that I was saying all of that all of that's wonderful and it was great and you know,
but he kept saying and I've been thinking about it you know he was writing this for me it was an extraordinary thing to be able to work,
with a friend and the story had a lot of resonances for me but that I think he,
knows about cuz he knows me and so it was something I was drawing in a deep well well of my past which almost made I,
was saying made me feel like it wasn't work in some strange way but I I think,
the thing that I thought was really amazing about it was it's a Christmas story it's genuinely A Christmas Story,
and because it's about selflessness ultimately these people all act selflessly towards each other so they,
can take a next step towards something it doesn't get resolved because he doesn't make movies that resolve very easily you know and it's like we don't,
know what's going to happen but they get a little bit forward but I thought this guy was very interesting it was very familiar to me to see this person who,
constructed this incredibly elaborate Persona you know and he's got all of these ideals and he's he's put together,
this whole kind of [ __ ] shtick you know and to watch somebody start to drop,
their stick but what's great about his movies is the mask goes away but it doesn't totally go away and it's so,
[ __ ] great the line of what he walks but to watch somebody watch all of these people in this thing lose their stick a,
little bit and connect and we were talking I was saying it's like you watch people just shed their [ __ ] and start to,
connect and I just thought this is beautiful and beautifully done so you,
know and yes I smell like fish and all that stuff but it was like was that was just a covering his f c yeah exactly,
exactly yeah well Mark uh you with poor,
things are signing up to join director yorgos Lanos writer Tony MC actress Emma,
Stone who had all previously done the favorite now they're getting back together and they need a guy to come in,
and play Duncan wurn a narcissistic ladies man who has an accent an attitude,
he's just such a colorful character and I wonder for you when the opportunity arose is it on one level intimidating to,
be joining that group of folks who are is it and then also I mean how what a fun character though yeah I uh I was,
like yo say I don't think I'm the right person for this yeah I tried to talk him out of it,
and he just laughed at me yeah it was just nothing that I'd,
ever I mean you know we a lot of us did come from theater right so you know when,
you're in theater no one ever is like oh you can't go from romantic comedy,
tragedia and you know like it just but but like in the movie business you started you started you feel like you're,
you're a little bit in a in a box sometimes and but I never played anything like that either and and I was,
scared I mean I saw his movies and I was in awe of them so I was really scared and he just laughed at me and so I was,
like okay it was such a great turn and I get to do so much fun stuff in it and uh,
break all the perceptions of me or what people want from me or you know you,
start to do something and people you you like all all a sudden Springs up a brand,
or whatever Persona yeah and um I got to bash that Robert I guess it's not a,
totally different situation with Oppenheimer where you are as Lewis,
struss but it's been a few years since you've played this type of a a character,
and I want to read you something that Christopher Nolan has said and then ask you to react if you would sure can you,
say it in accent please not not a good enough I'll try to make it register anyway here we go quote he's one of our,
great actors and though a generation of kids know what a great movie star he is they've not seen his subtlety and,
Brilliance I wanted to get him to do something completely different to lose himself in another human being when was,
the last time we've seen that chaplain directors are very aware of how talented Downey is but because of his incredible,
energy that can punch through the screen finding the right thing for him is difficult close quote do you think,
that's uh what do you make of that well first of all I didn't write that um Jeffrey said it it's it's all so,
small like there's all these trappings oh what's this and here's the genre and here's the character and here's what happens in the story you go no I made my,
decision based on this thing that nobody would ever know if I didn't tell them and that's almost always it I think you,
know he called a call from Nolan is a thing he asked me to come over and read,
the script on red paper with black type which was like doing sudoku while,
drowning and um but I read it and it was written in first person I was like this is this is masterful and I just thought,
the meditation for me was on that horrible thing that I I'm just going to,
venture a guess and say we all tend to do which is comparison comparing my insides to someone else's outsides how,
they're perceived they're special they're this and that and particularly in the context of that time period Hot,
War Cold War you know this is why this affected the way my parents counterculture was so anyway to me it,
was a it was it was a logical thing from senior going back into what is this thing that my dad's generation rebelled,
against and it was like a 100 people making a watch together every day and uh,
you know it's fun to realize what you're becoming accustomed to like it's okay so,
just a let's talk about my perks there are none okay well hold on a second you,
can have $300 a day to spend it however you like I was like that's my d cleaning,
bu so first of all I think you know maximum humility is where we get that,
spot whether we can choose to do it or the situation requires it's like you should be scared you should have,
approach anxiety to this because this is real [ __ ] if you do it right like I've,
seen this year you know like I've seen I love that you were saying it was a meditation on Grief and caretaking,
that's what I saw and dude what you were able to do with this thing of the horror,
wish fulfillment of being able to actually go back and talk to that which,
bore you and this Fable you did in this history where you constructed this character so just masterfully I mean,
dude a guy who wants to be freed but doesn't even know that he's trapped and,
and by giving and giving and giving he's it's his salvation it's like [ __ ] so,
it's always small Coleman you did 2020 film Mar's black bottom for George C,
wolf a guy who Jeffrey knows quite well as well works all the time I know him fairly well yeah George C wolf is,
looking to cast the part of by Russen who is unfairly kind of not remembered as much as he should be this is a black,
gay civil rights leader who was the principal organizer of the 1963 March on,
Washington so he comes to you you had one an Emmy for Euphoria you'd been Tony nominated for acting in the Scots World,
boys and producing Fatam you'd been in important movies like Lincoln and Selma,
but you had never been offered the chance to be at the top of a call sheet of a film prior to this so what did it,
mean to you when that opportunity came from George I had to learn deeply the principle of being in,
service and just in service to the story and that's what any journeyman has learned that it's not about the size of,
the role but it's about how do I help serve a function in the theater y'all,
know who the equity Deputy is it's usually,
me thank you where's,
my I appreciate it and that's exactly it that's the thing I've always I've always,
been the equity Deputy I've always been the one that had to look out for the other actors or or throw the parties or,
bring people together so it's a skill set that I've had deeply so when Rustin,
came along I knew that had to tap into that that part of service that part of service of making sure that I looked,
after the whole and I also took a leadership role and you know that role took everything I was I was able to give,
honestly there's those roles that we we we I don't know if we wish for but we hope for that we were able to give,
everything and I know that I've I've given everything in the in the 32 years that I've been in this industry from,
Regional Theaters to Off Broadway to writing to direct you name it it's in this film it called on everything that I,
had and more than anything it called on my spirit that truly believes in service and trying to be make sure that people,
feel heard and seen and that we're doing it in in a heartful mindful way because that's what the character by Rustin did,
he gave his life his life was about being in service to others and then history put him in the shadows and I,
thought it was my opportunity to really bring him out fully and construct a complex character that's loving and,
interesting and intelligent and messy and wild but spirited you know because I know that this film can have an impact I,
know who I am in a room and what I can do and what I can give and at the at the highest level I know that I'm a teacher,
and I'm in service to to work as an artist so it was truly my privilege to just give everything I could Andrew all,
of us strangers it's about a gay man living in present day London who visits,
his childh at home and finds living there the parents who he lost 30 years earlier very sudden,
you were basically being asked by Andrew he the filmmaker to play a version of,
himself this and I wonder if you can talk about both the idea that you're you're the person who you're playing is,
on the other side of the camera and also the sort of the challenges of that in particular where you know you're,
literally shooting in his childhood home I suppose I didn't really think of it like I was playing Andrew I felt like,
that we weirdly kind of co- parented the character considering that that's the sort of theme in the yeah in in the film,
um but I certainly looked to him he's like a comrade you know in in uh in in,
in the telling of the story and I suppose the challenge actually for me was to not pretend to be anybody else,
but to you know find out go back to a place where where I was and so it was,
sort of like a a marriage between our our two personalities and uh it was difficult because I I think I have a,
good imagination um but I think I but I think I do think I'm pleased with that,
because I do think that's the most I think it's the most important thing you can have as an actor that and and a sense of humor I really think that those,
they are the two things that well certainly for me that you keep going back to but there was a duality to,
because there's two sections to the to the film and one of them is about going back to Childish feelings and the other,
one is about very adult almost physic falling in love yeah and so how do you sort of do that without um making that,
being a boyish kind of gross or I don't know like gilding the Lily somewhat but uh because,
he was so generous in filming it in its family little Suburban home with one camera it's such a vulnerable thing to,
do and I could tell that uh all the brutality that comes within families,
accidental or not really was raw for him and I think he sees that in me and we were very sensitive with with each other,
and I could tell if I was affecting him that that M that really really mattered to him because he's not a,
Sentimental uh person but uh it's sort of shamelessly about the the tenderness,
of um of of families and the tenderness of love and the it's very feels very,
vulnerable so when I because because of the strike we didn't get to ever see it with a with an audience and we went to,
see it the first time the other night with with like 350 people and I was like I really did feel like oh God I feel,
like I was sitting there in the in the in the theater with no clothes on like um I was as,
well I just want to piggyback on there's so many times in in in this where it's,
that thing we're afraid of and you want to calibrate where you have to lose it you have to have these huge expulsions,
of emotion and you want them to be varied otherwise it just feels like you're hitting note number two so I want to know a the trust for that the,
intimacy the all that like that the risk factor I mean I heard that you trusted the guy but I'm just want to say but,
like how how did you navigate all that honestly I suppose uh I never thought,
that I would be able to be in a film to play that kind of character at least uh,
when I was growing up I was so obsessed with with films and acting in films um,
just watching great great acting and uh I suppose to be able to play a character just look what you what you just said,
there about I can play that I can play that music that's exactly the way I felt I feel like I can play those play those,
notes so I suppose the attempt it's like we were saying earlier I feel like is how do you not act how do you how do you,
not do that and I don't think he can really do that without some sort of support within the script I I just don't,
think or the other actors um and then I suppose you just let go and you you use your use your imagination don't we I,
don't know um but it's a weird thing is that sometimes with certain certain projects they just have magic some of,
them and you can work on things and you can feel real hope and uh huge love for,
them and they just don't and then some of them just you know just the light and it just ignites that's it's it's a,
strange thing isn't it one of the really beautiful scenes in this movie all of us strangers is when your character gets to,
come out to his parents who he was never able to do that to in real time and I I,
do want to bring up something that I think is fairly noteworthy which is and sadly still somewhat of a rarity even in,
2023 but both Andrew you and Coleman you are openly gay actors playing openly gay,
characters who are at the center of important films to actors who may not,
yet be in a place where they feel they can be open about their sexuality worry that could hinder their prospects in,
this business do you believe that things have gotten better over the course of your decades in this business from the,
very beginning I've always been exactly who I was there was never a coming out story but also I thought that I always,
wanted to lead in rooms with my intelligence and kindness and what I do MH and it wasn't really something that,
was actually on the table you know in the beginning you're challenged because you you think you look around and you feel kind of rare like other people are,
sort of like hiding that aspect and I thought well why I remember somebody,
asked me this years ago and I thought it was a weirdest question after I work with um a very well-known director who's,
straight and some interviews said so how does um how does so- and so feel about you being gay it was the weirdest,
question I thought he's my brother he's like my brother what are you talk but also I was like what world do you live in you know what I mean so I just,
thought like what does that matter and I still feel that way I feel like you know being gay is just like one aspect of me,
but it's not everything and I feel like I've and I've never put limitations on what I do it's like I've had you know I,
play you played pimps I've played in The Color Purple I played Mis and but I also,
and maybe that's the thing I've always believed if I don't put limitations on myself this industry won't put limitations on me but if I'm walking,
around with the secret and hiding but I think you see that I need to be my fullest self to access everything you,
feel that way I I'm going to make a pitch for getting rid of the expression,
openly gay yeah yes hear me out here we go I'm with you it's an expression that we actually only ever hear in the media,
you are never at a party and you say this is my openly gay trans has that ever,
happened never you never say it not once why do we put openly in front of that,
adjective you know we don't say you're openly Irish you don't say you're openly left-handed whatever don't even say hi,
it's two steps away from sh it's there there's something that's in it that's a little near shamelessly you're sh you're,
open about it you know what I'm saying and I just you know I nearly prefer I nearly prefer Shameless I near I nearly,
I prefer that and sometimes I just feel like like if you got to say it to understand to understand it just say you,
know Ju Just say out possibly or you know what sometimes just don't say anything at all say I get it but I just,
I think there's something about it that that is you're you're openly get now I think it's just time to to sort of to,
sort of park it I mean and I think that's the the the strange thing exactly as you're saying representation is a,
wonderful thing but you know we're talking an awful lot here about transformation representation of,
transformation and look I wouldn't be here if if if representation hadn't um improved but I do think transformation,
is very important for actors we love it we love it when our our mother is reading us a story and she turns into a,
wolf and you go because it speaks to our empathy it speaks to our and I think it frightens us some sometimes to be able,
to sort of go okay well I can't because I don't have the same biographical um story as else that I can't think of,
because that's what connects us and I think there's a danger of of us all actually just being separated a little,
bit more because I think it's a dangerous idea to put a clamp on transformation because that's not the,
shouldn't be the priority the the priority should be clamping down on the Prejudice within our industry and,
looking at who gets to transform not the transformation itself wow yeah so so,
just that's my I don't want to offend anybody openly gay but bye-bye bye-bye,
see you late see you later I'm openly straight yeah exactly thank you for,
saying that shess I'm almost shamelessly straight Sho now I'm getting to the,
point where I can almost be Shameless heterosexual by,
default so another thing that may be shifting in,
our business I guess is the mid-range budget movie which some of these fall,
into but are becoming increasingly endangered there's you know the movies,
that I think EST you know were part of establishing many of the people at this table I don't know if they would be made,
today and I I'd love to hear your thoughts on that and also the repercussions of that is it is the fact,
that that project today May well be made on TV something that makes you more,
interested in doing TV or or just uh Mark take us away because I can just I,
saw you nodding a little bit and I think like I I don't know would you can count on me kids are all right we could go on,
and on are these would they be made today you know I do think the one one of the good things that came out of the,
strike was these interim Indie this kind of preferential um treatment towards,
interim Indie projects I went out and did one it was a 10 episodes of,
independent television for $5 million wow and that was about the so that's you,
know six hours of Television that was uh,
less than what we made you can count on me for or around the same and it was doable I mean it was a,
grind and I haven't done that in a long time but it was doable and they were,
able to give the actors everything that Screen Actors Guild had asked for the,
production company agreed to do it it wasn't like Breaking the Bank wasn't,
impossible and I do feel like what happened with streaming was was we all,
ran to do it because it was another kind of freedom and it was an economic freedom and it was directors and writers,
had another kind of Freedom that they didn't in the studio world right and and so we all ran to do it but what happened,
was it just created a vacuum in the Indie world and and now I feel like there's a,
chance to have this Resurgence of that and there's a more of a I hope more of a,
thoughtfulness about the possibility of that now now I'll I'll look at an indie picture much different than I did two or,
three years ago how so like I know we made a good piece of Television like I,
know that and I know it wasn't n because of the budget it was because of the story it was because of the heart it was,
because of of the commitment to it and so you don't need to make a movie for,
6070 million for it to be good you don't you don't need that I know that for a fact and and a lot of us come from that,
that truth and so I hope that you know I didn't mind taking the I didn't mind,
working seg low budget I mean I can afford it you know but I didn't mind it,
did mhm let me add this too I think the model has to change and just recently,
like me and my partners we we produced a film called Sing Sing that premiered at Tiff and we kept the budget very low and,
want to tell you we kept it very low but we made sure it was Equitable for everyone every single every single person had a point that's what we did,
above the line below the line we sold it to a24 and we're selling internationally and it's like everyone feels a part of,
this so we keep it low but but it makes it Equitable for everyone so every Rises when we win and everyone gives a full,
heart and have some ownership if it does good they do we all do good okay why not it's a simple model isn't it fair it's,
simple you know exactly what it is ex everything's transparent every you know the problem with that though it's too,
much like doing the right thing right to much doing the right thing that's why that's why it's not industry standard,
you know I mean it's a very it's just shared Equity yeah I mean you can make a living but you can't make a,
killing but more make a living yeah yeah let's close with something that,
hopefully will be a little fun the worst audition that you ever went on I went in for a Dr Pepper commercial they came out,
in the hallway and they said okay you're the pi Piper and everybody wants to be,
like you and I just stood up and and,
walked so I didn't have a chance to be bad there you go who else right decision,
PA did you ever have something audition for one musical Once A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the for yeah and,
I just was like every time you came to that the you're supposed to burst into song I just started laughing I couldn't,
do it and I walked out of the room I was like I I just thought I can't do a musical but I'll go in I I just couldn't,
do it I couldn't do it was really embarrassing I've got a story this I don't know if it translates so well it,
may sound fairly entitled or something like this but maybe not so I I there was this role I'm not going to be specific,
there was this role based on on this book that was really interesting subject that was really interesting is being,
directed by this super uh well regged uh somewhat of a legend director you might,
be able to figure this out I don't know anyway so I'd read at audition a couple okay we're going to do a read through,
out in La I'm in New York great okay cool W this is good I we we fly on this,
director's plane his private plane where he's got a you know he's a part of a uh,
you know Syndicate or you owning the plane he wasn't wow but we,
fly we fly out with the TA number we do I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll I'll,
tell you why I don't know I'll tell you why I don't we get out we do the reading we're all gathered around that thing we,
do the reading okay I'm going I don't know how that went okay I go back to my,
hotel room I get a phone call yeah um so uh Jeffrey that was interesting I don't,
think you're going back on the plane we're going to fly you back SE no like oh okay commercial wow I,
commercial I have to fly first [Laughter],
class yeah that was but that was that was a kick in the uh oh boy in the,
things okay ended up working with that director later like on something few years later but okay next one best piece,
of advice you've gotten from a fellow actor or at Le let's say most memorable piece of advice you've gotten from a fellow actor the best piece of advice I,
got from a fellow actor it was a pilot it was with James uh fantino and I had a,
little bit of a monologue and and I I didn't know it really well and he just,
turned to me and he's like learn your [ __ ] lines yeah yeah yeah,
yeah and I should have known better I did long day journey into,
tonight on in the in the theater and Donald muffett played um what's he called the the father and it's all about,
the frugality of of um drinking it's all about the whiskey bottle and the father's he's obsessed with how much,
people have some has somebody drunk his whiskey and I was doing the same you doing blah blah blah and he turned around to me and he said I don't believe,
the way you pour that was such a good note because I was pouring the [ __ ] whiskey in like,
as if where these people would have been and I remember 20 years old at the time and I was like what I don't even I,
couldn't even I couldn't even understand that that detail was but of course that's stuff that you have to think,
about that's not about what you're saying but about how you're behaving so um and uh so then like it was a good one,
which living actor who you've not worked with before would you most like to work with Coleman immediately I I thought,
Emma Stone oh yeah immediately I thought that she's so uh I I'm sure I can feel,
it I can feel that she's inventive and kind and generous and quirky and weird,
and you feel like she's going to just give you a gift every day and you're like how am I going to respond yeah yep,
y good good call she's Precious Precious artist yeah I wish I could have worked,
with Robert Duval I mean you you've worked with him right and yeah I wish I could have I mean I very old now so I,
don't know that I will but I wish I could have sure I'll say this Dustin Hoffman yeah mhm simply because when I,
started off doing this stuff it was like that he was like the guy that I you know from papon to uh you know to to to,
Midnight Cowboy to these transformative roles you know in which he you know he just you know he just refashioned a new,
every time that that that's what made it that's what I thought it was that this stuff that you know this acting stuff i',
yeah I'd love to do that if you could change lives for a day with someone at this table just to see what it's like to,
be them who would it be and why really Coleman saying I do I think,
you're such a fascinating person I was gonna say I want to be the guy who's willing to be the EP de I'm,
serious I'm not kidding I was like I want to be you cuz I want to be that guy I want to be the guy was like yes [ __ ],
it I'll do that you know me said the guy was like no no seriously I I'm serious I,
was like you because I want to be that guy I want to be that guy who's willing to do to do that no no no it would be,
fun to be Mr wri and just be in a psyche where I'm always capable of tying,
someone up like a pretzel with a thought if I need to put them in check oh boy oh,
boy sorry I I think you you know those those,
moves I projected them on you then so it would just be like i' be like oh my God,
that's the same place look at that would you mind,
swapping swap let's do it openly swapping openly,
swapping Let's Make a Deal let's make a anybody want to ratify this come on we,
have you all okay last two if you had not become an actor what would you be doing today,
oh my gosh I don't know I wanted to be an animator but I don't know yeah I,
that's what I wanted to yeah I know that's what I wanted to do but talk about something that's even harder than this,
and is even more crazy but I did want to be an animator whether I would have been I don't know but that's what I wanted to do I tried but it didn't work out I got,
into Johnson and Wales uh to be a chef actually that's what I wanted to be I,
really thought you I still I'm I think I'm a really really good cook I feel like I'm a good cook and I'm a great good host but also I want to be you I,
want to be this guy but it's funny already I'm thinking like that third Act of my life I feel like I want to,
investigate architecture I'm just an architecture nerd and I'm always thinking maybe I go back to school and,
learn that and do that when I'm like 70 you know I don't know yeah I started taking art classes of sculpture classes,
at the art students league in New York City I recently yeah and I love that and I um it gives me a lot of what I get,
from this and if that was a possibility I would throw that would be a good,
second act you know or teaching nice I'd love to teach maybe robertt if I wasn't,
an actor I would be doing a hard,
time I want know what crimes he would have committed though I trumped up felony possession again but I this this,
time it was on a Hummer these cops set up but still jury you know,
whatever judge got pissed off bench warrant oh [ __ ] I was the same guy from the other stuff so Ed a,
cumulative Ed it's really weird there's a there's a theme my mother was an art teacher on when I got my first film when,
I was 17 on exactly the same day it was a little Irish film on exactly the same,
day I won this burer to educate myself as a as a painter for like five years a big burer and I chose [ __ ] show,
business so i' go but you would do that I would definitely do that because it's so,
frustrating now I don't know if you do do you I don't painting yeah it's really it's really hard because if you don't,
exercise those muscles you lose them it's so frustrating but that's what I do that's what I do yeah uh you know I mean,
I I started acting my junior year college I was a political science major you I grew up in DC what else you going,
to do um my mom was a lawyer for the government um so that was the idea and,
probably if I weren't doing this I'd be a lawyer maybe I don't know maybe a a,
criminal lawyer I'd be I'd be uh i' be Robert I'd be your father I'd be I'd be,
defending now you can make a,
career it's a growth industry well guys on on behalf of The,
Hollywood Reporter thank you so much,
for all right so I feel like we learned a lot from today's round table first order of business please keep Robert,

Hotel in Santa Monica California now as you know The Hollywood Reporter brings the industry's biggest and brightest,
stars to together for legendary conversations and guess what today is no different we are about to hear from six,
actresses who were in some of this year's most talked about films from the billion dooll Blockbuster that caused a,
pink paint shortage you know what I'm talking about it's Barbie to Martin scors say three and a half hour intermission lless epic but guys it was,
worth every minute that's right killers of the flower Moon so strap in use the restroom now you have been warned and,
let's get ready for a beautiful conversation between Anette Benny ly,
Gladstone Greta Lee Carrie Mulligan Margot,
Robby and Emma Stone they are on the record but maybe,
just a bit off script with The Hollywood Reporter take it away Rebecca thanks ion,
hello and welcome to the Hollywood reporters actress Roundtable let's dive in how would you describe your job to a,
5-year-old playing pretend yeah playing pretend I remember playing pretend I,
once heard an actress talk about this and I kind of was like oh God that sounds like a little kind of I don't know corny but you know what I remember,
playing pretend really well I remember the feeling of like how deep can I get in it I'm the frontier woman in the,
backyard grinding berries that was one of my faves and and playing Mommy I,
actually used to play with dolls but yeah playing pretend and it is a it is a,
grown-up version of that Greta how would you explain I lie to them and and I I,
have two children who are seven and four um but I mean all kidding is I mean I,
it's it's one of those things where I I I tell them it's the most important job in the world and I'm saving lives um,
there's doctor and there's me um no I think um and this is something that,
becomes more true I think just aging um and wanting to,
appreciate just the The Burning Desire the the love of something and to and for,
me specifically telling my kids I love this and um for them to get to see it I,
think has been really just wonderful and sometimes very difficult because they,
don't understand all of it um but it is it's that shared love of the thing you,
know and sometimes it is hard to put into words so sometimes then you lie Annette I had heard that when you,
were on niad you would tease jod Foster like right before the director's called action is that true I probably I hadn't,
thought about that but I mean I do goof around a lot I kind of helps me relax sometimes it sort of depends because,
some people don't really enjoy doing that and so you have to be careful there are some actors who are actually,
serious no but looking at me uh no I do do that sometimes to just,
to keep things loose and you know you go in with a lot of uncertainty and uh you,
want that right you want it's like planned uncertainty you want to try to find something that surprises you and,
maybe your partner Jodie is such a fine actress that I felt so lucky you know,
because uh acting is reacting and listening and just taking from the other person so yeah I probably did do that I,
like to have a good time I like to you know goof around Emma I know yorgos lanth Theos is sort of known for doing,
these um exercises and games and stuff with actors when they're in rehearsals,
did you do that on poor things was it helpful what what kinds of things we I was out there about a month before we,
started shooting and we did three about three weeks of rehearsal which was similar to the amount of time we had on,
the favorite and it's wonderful because you none of it is literal like you're not blocking out the scenes or or going,
through the lines and the way that you know it will happen on camera so you're doing like games where you're all kind,
of tied get I mean it's true theater games like you know or or like everyone has to shut their eyes and walk around,
and one person is assigned to put a chair under them as they sit like you you know it's just completely silly so,
you embarrass yourself in front of each other and then you kind of get really close really quickly so by the time,
you're on set you feel like you know each other really well and it's just like you can experiment and be free and make fun of each other and it's you know,
no um kind of eggshell experience with your other actors which is really really,
helpful other people have like something similar a way to just sort of quickly get intimate and get comfortable on a,
set anything that's worked for you just so validating like hearing that from both of you you know I'm I'm a goofball,
on set and I tend to play really serious roles and my Foundation is in theater so a lot of these games it's a fun job I,
mean obviously there's like I'm saying it's fun and then I saw Killers over the flower Moon I'm like it's it's,
fun obviously there's so like really really you know heavy emotional very,
important stories that are being told but if you can find the sort of like,
levity or at least that to to me it feels like you were saying like it feels so good to kind of have that levity in,
between because acting yeah is fun like it's a you're playing pretend forever,
and a lot of that stuff I mean in theater and in like film is just not feeling like a complete tit when you get,
you know like to feel like okay you're not going to think I'm first of all terrible at this or you know like and I,
feel that from like I need to feel that with the crew as well like I need I need the DP to think I'm not like I need,
you know so I need to I feel like the best case scenario is when you get there and it's your act your your director,
your co- actors but also the crew are all like MH you can't be bad and then,
you're in a good place but is that takes away the self-awareness a little bit when like you're Happ everyone feels,
like they're making the same thing yeah and that's one of the great things about film is I feel like when you're in theater it's such an actor's game yeah,
yeah it's so it's like Sumer Camp should should feel like completely but it also helps when you're shooting things like,
you know like you said it's and I've said it to everybody that was on set we have no business having this much fun,
making this film but it's also there were so many Native actors and so many Native crew and Extras and when we're,
together like I mean Indians just laugh you know which I think helped with,
sustaining some of the importance of it because you're surrounded by a this is the community that's being impacted and,
this is that makes the tragedy stronger I mean we've got that dual mask for a reason I feel like I kind of need the,
goofy to like springboard into the the drama sometimes completely otherwise,
you're just like the heaviness of it is excruciating yeah I don't know what you,
guys are talking I am dead serious High art that work it's not a joke am,
I ising to you guys didn't have any Barbie was not fun I bet it was not fun,
how did you like how did you how did you recover at the end of the day it was I know I lost,
myself was there an onet therapist for you did you have people call you Barbie,
I mean off camera I mean the funny thing is in our script everyone was because everyone's Barbie and everyone's Ken,
everyone's name was in the script so I'm Barbie Margo says to Ken,
Ryan and Barbie Issa says to you know like so all it's weird seeing your name in a script when you're reading it,
you're like isn't it kind of amazing how it's become like a sort of Sisterhood greeting now where you just people you,
see people go hey Barbie like that's just how we don't know I had a friend who's like running on the beach and wearing something pink just by chance,
and someone was like hi Bobby and they like they yelled back hi Bobby they like I'm in it now,
how did you how did you think about how Barbie would move like what her physicality would be that was really fun,
and obviously Guided by Greta but me yeah welcome she she knew it how serious,
Al set needed to be like I no um yeah it was I love physical comedy and I like my,
favorite era of film is like the 30s when it's like all head to toe acting like you know cuz the frame is so head,
to toe and it's all yeah it's I love scre bble comedies and I love that so I've always been,
excited to have the chance to do very physical comedy but it was also like the the line between I wanted there to be an,
evolution between how she moved and spoke from the beginning of the film to the end of the film and it shouldn't be,
obvious to the audience but the it should by the end of it you should be like oh yeah I'm looking at someone who's being a doll and then by the end,
of it you're like I think I'm watching Margot like I I wanted to kind of by the,
end have morphed into being human without people realizing and we did that in a number of ways um you know like the,
wig started off with like tons of volume and hair and then got smaller smaller shorter shorter until it looked more,
like normal natural hair and the costumes went you know I spoke to jacine I was like okay she's got to have very,
certain like shapes and a lot of structure and like definite colors definite patterns everything should be,
constructed and then as we go by the end the fabric should be soft the pattern,
should be messy but still feminine and like so we did you know things like that and then with the physicality and you,
know I would just kind of went from being very certain to kind of Uncertain by the end in a good way so I wanted you,
know my speech patent to be at the start like I'm having a dance party that's going to be a song that's going to be this you should come by and by the end,
you know the way like when we talk in real life you have like hesitation and you stumble on words or like you leave a,
gap before you say the next thing because you're trying to think of it so I wanted to have a speech by the end to have that quality to it and at the,
beginning to just be very certain no hesitation I can't even remember what,
your question was she was just asking like what are you doing we didn't need a sounds,
awesome like sit that transition was so fun to watch,
though like watching that gear shift and just the human emotions starting to sink,
in I mean I think a lot of us needed that after the last several years I I,
felt that on set too like people were so excited to be back on set again and like,
yeah it's like we all went for it even more because we were even more great like I think I'm always so grateful that,
I even get to make movies but you just felt that everyone was like oh my God we get to make movies again so everyone,
really wanted to go for it and barie kind of like that setting in the environment gr created was very lent,
itself to going for it and and really like being in and joyful and so silly I,
mean everyone was so silly in front of each other all the time and yeah it was amazing it was so fun it was like yeah a,
NeverEnding dance poy Greta hearing Margot talk about the language change in Barbie made me think of your working in,
both Korean and English in past lives how much Korean did you know when you got that part how much did you have to,
learn um I was I was terrified that I was going to mess up the Korean I grew,
up speaking Korean but it's not I think it's I don't know it's something it's hard to explain unless you you are,
bilingual um it's like I'd forgotten that I could speak Korean because of the life that I was living um in America you,
know so right away that was something that was going to be very vulnerable for,
me and exposing um but I guess I like to do this thing before I start a job where,
I kind of make this informal list of um I guess I can just call them like challenges that lie ahead I like to make,
it tangible because so much of what we do is so internal and this list for past,
lives was we're shooting on 35 millimeter I've never done that before it was my first time playing the lead,
role after 20 years of working and I didn't know how to do that I I I'd never,
done that before um and you know we were shooting in New York City it was a time,
span of 12 Years years of playing different ages um and the costumes there,
was nowhere to hide I I'd come from doing a lot of heightened characters where I could use the the makeup or the,
the clothing to yeah I I I had none of that and then at the very bottom of this,
list was the Lang was Korean speaking almost entirely in Korean um was almost,
like the jacket on top of all of these other concerns um which maybe was helpful in,
the end but it's it's a huge responsibility to accurately portray,
these certain nuances of what it's like to be to have that Duality that cultural Duality and I did a lot of funny things,
where I asked instead of a conventional dialect coach who could kind of give me,
the perfect South Korean accent I asked for this incredible woman uh Sharon Choy,
who you guys might know you remember from maybe the,
Oscars thing with her she could translate in the moment,
Jokes which to me was something that is required yeah actual genius no offense,
you're a genius too but she I know you're so but I really needed to find,
somebody who could understand it's it's similar to what you're talking about trying to show this whole spectrum of,
this Human Experience but this range that isn't sort of wiped clean um and,
made sort of flat and I needed to find specifically someone who could help me,
um even within one scene the way she starts out sound sounding after years of not speaking Korean that she would sound,
kind of like a white girl and maybe after hours of talking to her childhood sweetheart in Korean that she would,
sound more Korean and and what that means in showing that whole range so I,
was I felt really so relieved to find her and and to yeah to have her as as a,
tool hearing you talk about that you had played heightened characters reminded me I've heard you say growing up you were,
watching characters played by like M Kilmer and Nick Cage and that that's what you envisioned for yourself and it,
kind of makes me wonder what did everybody watch growing up and see you,
know a version of what they assumed they would play or what they hoped they would play did anybody have a particular,
performer or type of performance in their minds I watched a lot of horn,
films again that physical comedy I think I just really enjoy great comedian,
really does her whole body with it and yeah yeah I feel compelled to explain,
the vomer no I see it I see it thank you we're always up for the same stuff bow,
give me a shot I feel like like growing up I felt,
fiercely competitive but not with other women with men yeah and there was this,
quality growing up of seeing certain kinds of actors and performers like Val,
like Nicholas Cage these sort of like Jack Nicholson these very athletic um,
kinds of performances that as the little girl that I was I was jealous and I I,
wanted that and and then later of course that that evolved as I grew and you know,
I and then I was attracted to other kinds of performances like Charlotte rampling or Maggie Chong or but that's,
that's that was how I started off um because it felt like some sort of benign,
resistance like some sort of like I don't like as a little girl to be to say like no I want I wanted that I wanted to,
be Daniel de Lewis yes I like I Saw The Crucible and I was like I want to play I don't want to play the I play his part,
like that was the the best part and and he was the best yeah is the best pH hman,
and Kate Blanchett if I can diffuse the two of them into one those are my two,
perfect actors really um I mean childhood Inspirations it's pretty out there now I,
wanted to be an Ewok and that's what started all this madness really,
legit literally and I haven't let it go yeah maybe feel like we,
would y a lot of body compression work I think I can do it um no yeah but you,
said Margo you wanted to play the boys always yeah yeah that's what kind of,
spawned your production company right like the men always had the best parts in this every time I read it I was like,
the mail roll I was like nope we got to make it so you read the female role and you're like she's got the best scenes,
she's got all the the moment she's got it Annette what about you well I I didn't see a lot of movies,
as a kid um I did see Sound of Music so I love that movie and I love Julie,
Andrews when I got to be a little bit older like when I was in community college and I started doing because I,
started doing theater and I just when I was in high school and I just loved doing plays and then I was going to this,
dollar a unit Community College that just happened to have a great theater Department,
so I started doing plays I remember seeing at the little Art House theater in San Diego I remember seeing,
Persona um that was the first time I had seen something like that believe Olman,
BB Anderson so that she began to really intrigue me leave Olman of course great,
actress made all of those amazing films with igar Bergman um and I began to get,
interested in that I didn't really start thinking about doing movies till I was old a bit older but um I certainly,
admired Vanessa Redgrave she was one of my big heroes um there was something about her,
quality too um that I really admired um,
yeah and I just I just did plays for many years and so then I didn't really start until I was almost 30 to do movies,
so I didn't kind of grow up with that mentality of thinking about it um you,
know I just didn't I just couldn't imagine it kind of but I would see a great movie and then I would think,
oh wow that's so powerful to see a great movie like loving it and thinking well I,
guess somebody has to be in them I remember having that thought somebody has to try somebody has to be out there,
saying maybe could it be me Emma I was thinking about your,
character Bella in poor things usually when I ask an actor about a role I I'm thinking what did you have to learn what,
did you have to prepare and with Bella I thought what did you have to unar,
because you're basically playing a child in in your grown-up woman's body so how,
did you how did you even start with that um it was jorus and I talked about,
about Bell for a long time we he told me about the book and sort of the adaptation that he and Tony were working,
on Tony magnam who wrote who wrote the favorite and also cruel so it was my third time working with,
Tony by the time we by the time we made po things and um he he basically gave me,
the outline and then we talked about it for four years so I didn't read a draft,
for like two years so it's just sort of started to I guess I've never had a a,
project go on that long or sort of sit with me for that long so I think it started to just sort of like through,
osmosis I would think about um aspects of it but because she's in a a full,
grown healthy body you know it's not like even you could compare it to like,
someone who's been in an accident and lost their memory and is relearning how to walk or how to move that wasn't,
really comparable and then also looking at you know videos or ideas of like toddlers beginning to walk their bones,
are still growing and they're still forming so she doesn't have that so we,
tried to just sort of map her physicality as much as possible but in a way that it was really amazing because,
there was nothing to compare it to it was completely just kind of like we just experimented with things and he' be like,
no that's that's insane and I be like I know try this one Whatever but insane good but,
insane s what do you insane like okay um but so we I mean the two of us really,
just kind of talked about it for for years and then uh and same with her kind of evolution in language and how she,
develops and you know what words she does or doesn't say how she refers to herself or other people she's just my,
favorite character of all time because of that unlearning,
she's totally without shame she's pure,
joy and curiosity and experimentation and adventure and has no qualms about,
her body or her you know experience or food or drink or you know the way she,
relates to other people it's so it was so inspiring to me on a daily basis and it was really like I just I I miss her,
all the time because she was so she's so alive um and so open to to life that it,
was like a very it was a very inspiring person to get to try to be every day or,
to live up to um did you ever feel embarrassed or like would do something,
where you like a part of your brain were like oh my God I look like an idiot right now or do you just get there and you're like,
completely similarly to what you were just saying I love I love physical comedy too I love the sort of and it you,
know and neos's films are are you know dark comedies but they're definitely,
comedy so it feels like growing up for me My Heroes were Gilder Rader Molly Shannon like I was watching SNL growing,
up so like that was my that was my like Pinnacle I you know I loved that world,
so much so I think that that sort of goofiness or or what would be embarrassment is so sort of I don't know,
freeing I find that so so much fun and like I don't I don't do not take myself,
seriously in any way so people like laughing at something I'm attempting to do doesn't really bother me but I also,
it's a testament to working with a director that you truly truly trust,
admire believe in and know is the captain of the ship in a way that you can be you can really let go cuz cuz I,
think we've probably all worked in experiences where you feel like you also have to be the captain and you don't,
fully trust that you can do it all or throw it all out there because you don't know what exactly they're seeing or how,
they're going to bring it together which is a really difficult at least to me because I don't,
want to direct I it's really difficult to sort of like have to think in two minds of like well if this if I give you,
this option take you're going to use it I know you are and I don't want do that so I have to whatever to not,
feel that at all which I don't with Yos I feel like whatever we try I'm like I know he's going to go with whatever is,
best for the film is like the greatest totally thing you know um and did you,
work with like a movement coach or like how did you come up with the phys it was just him and I we just sort of like in,
rehearsals we would go and we would have like walking rehearsals you know for like a couple hours and then just like all right and we and we created stages,
so it was stage one to five so because at the beginning of the film we're in willam's character's house the my mad,
scientist kind of father God and that was only stage one and five and we,
hadn't shot the middle yet so it was like her beginning and her end um so all,
of that we just sort of mapped out so we knew like okay we're in stage three right now so for this you know these,
couple of things we're walking this way and we sort of were able to like curate it a little bit in that way but would,
you like film it and then have it on your phone so you could be like oh yeah this stage looks like no you just rely,
on to be just the sort of feeling of it because it's because you are going from a progression of like of like that sort,
of sides of the feet and you know to walking flat so whatever that would I,
don't know is this oh this is what we're here to talk [Applause] about every time I talk about acting for,
more than like five minutes I'm like sorry about that was Suzuki part of your,
training then you said walking on the sides of your feet did you do Suzuki method when you were doing your theater,
what isuki method I mean it was developed it's it's it's kind of like martial arts training but it's for,
actors because I mean the theory is that you have to be in such command of your instrument as an actor that you would,
could be able to I think as he said run toward the lip of a stage and then stop on a dime so wow I'm a very untrained,
actually Lily I remember you saying that on killers of the flower moon when you put the blanket on and some of the,
costume on it it changed the way you sat it changed the way you stood how did that sort of shape making Molly I mean I,
almost had the opposite with the language I knew that she would be in the language first and then it's always the,
last step you're in the shoes you're in the clothes you're in the character until the audience or if the crew is,
there um but yeah I I was most worried,
about getting the fluency and I guess like I guess it matched Marty talked about the rewrite of the the script,
initially from the FBI's investigation of these murders which had reduced Molly to I think three scenes in the original,
draft to inverting it that it was the inside out I mean that's kind of I think,
how I had to work with her because o Sage is it's a it's one of the more thriving,
uh Native languages in this country most most indigenous languages in North,
America are anthropologists would say dead languages and you know meaning that,
there aren't many first language speakers still alive and that's very true in a lot of cases so Osage have a,
language vitalization hugely like beautiful like um cohesive language Department that,
they bring into schools they have their own orthography so that was the first thing I did is I learned the Sonic,
system because you know all this physical training the you're learning the world view,
you're learning the pace of the character and I found actually at the end I asked for a lot of my scenes that,
were ended up being in English for ease of the audience to read there were a lot of scenes I had written in English that,
I asked to be translated into oage so almost all of my dialogue at some point I spoke in O sage and that's where I,
really found Molly was in the language first and it took months to get comfortable with it o Sage is a very,
difficult language um I speak a little bit of black feet language where I grew,
up and I grew up hearing that so that Sonic system and those phone and everything were familiar to me o ages I,
felt so clunky and so robotic and so like stage one with it um so when I had,
kind of a handle of the language and I guess with Alexander feeling loose with it then putting putting on oage dress,
and holding myself the way I was told oldage women especially at the time hold themselves I was in my first fitting,
with with Julie o'keef and I remember when my broad cloth skirt heavy wool in Oklahoma in the middle of the summer oh,
are tough people um and it's folded a certain way it it is a folded blanket,
and it's all folds and all ties and when Julie tied me into the skirt I and then my first thought was I,
absolutely understand how the oage nation gave birth to America's First Prima ballerina Maria tall Chief and holding,
the blanket as well it's like okay okay my Foundation was in ballet before acting I was like have to stand first,
position and hold that blanket and fold it so and then to okay have this that,
feels very stiff that is not very comfortable in a modern body but then to have ease with it and what funny aspect,
of that was I have a long torso and short legs Leo has a has long legs and a,
short torso so when I was sitting as Molly even in Repose as Molly I always look taller than him,
which I love like embracing that Vibe they had to fly in a little booster,
form every time Carrie one sort of resource you had,
as you were working on Maestro is the Burnstein children who were really involved what kinds of things did you,
learn from them how did it help you oh man so much um they were just so lovely,
to us um so I still I I st I kind of signed on to the project,
about four years before we shot it um and not long afterwards Bradley asked if,
I wanted to he said I want you to really go all in you know and I think like you,
know I thought in my head okay but you know not really but,
yes wink wink um you know because it's you know I again like not a trained actor but um and and you know so I was a,
little bit like nervous of that and then um you know we I don't think there was really a script then and we were talking,
and then at some point I was um I was at his house and he said um so yanii Seguin,
who's like this incredible conductor Philadelphia Orchestra he said he's he was sort of the musical guide and he,
said he wants us to come to Philadelphia and narate candid do you want to do it and I was like,
yes what the do that know what that means that doesn't what does that but how do you narrate an opera um so anyway,
we went and we narrated this Opera and they came and uh to we we rehearsed it for like three or four days and then we,
did three performances and narrating candid essentially there is a narrator and then we split it and we did this the,
three performances and they came to the I think maybe the final one and I met them for the first time and um it was,
like embracing family they were so unbelievably warm and still I mean every time I see them now they just grab me,
and like you know um and so we zoomed a bit over the years and you know I,
started with like a notebook you know to take down notes on and then after a,
minute I thought well this is pointless because they just the stories were just flying so um so many amazing anecdotes,
and a family that you just wanted to be in you know like they had everything was an inside joke everything was a secret,
language everything was you know they just had all these fun like traditions and um so a million things a million,
things about and and you know they gave me her lighter Felicia's lighter which is in the film so she she got it when,
she was married it's engraved with her name on um so from the from when they're married when the when the film turns to,
color I'm always using her lighter which was um amazing to have so yeah I mean everything everything lot of smoking all,
oh God how was that for you so much smoking is that mug wart or what are we talking those are,
the yeah do you get Crazy headaches from those awful they're so they give me the,
worst heada but they did they just smoked they like famously just smoked constantly and Jamie writes that she's,
written wrot this amazing book Jamie Bernstein called famous father girl and she talks about being brought down in,
her pajamas after bath time to see her parents to say good night and they were sitting in their finery with their,
cocktails and their friends and they would be smoking and they would you give them and it just I mean sounds so fabulous um but um yeah always well who,
did you use as references did you use act yeah so there's amazing recordings this guy John Gru and went and spent the,
summer with them in ansedonia and um and interviewed for it was called private world of lonard Bernstein was a kind of,
um coffee table book about him and the family a bit but largely about him and he interviewed them and um and he,
interviewed her so there's about two sort of 40 minute chunks of her talking um so we we and that was just that was,
such a treasure Trove because she talked about you know the the real the most exciting thing about it was this the,
first hook was you know the idea of two artists living concurrently together making a life together and one of them,
being literally touched by God and the other one being an arst artist she spoke about that in the recording well she she,
didn't in so many words but you know the sense of like you know um Steven Spielberg who's one of our producers,
said to Bradley um when they were talking about it uh originally you know she she was an amazing actress she was,
more successful than Lenny when they first met uh but she devoted her life to him and and Steven said of Felicia Lenny,
was her art you know but that she decided that that was what she was the bigger kind of um you know that was the,
bigger need in her life was be so yeah so the tapes in the family were just amazing did you feel like you were able,
to come to some understanding about how she felt about the marriage not only him becoming so enormous culturally but also,
his affairs with men how you know how that affected the family did you feel like you were able to understand what,
the impact was on her yeah I think so I mean I think you know it's always so tricky is it when you play a real person,
you feel like you know I met her her kids but I also went to Chile and I met her Chilean family and um and her,
brother-in-law who was 95 at the time he sadly passed away um but he was in ansedonia with them when those tapes,
were being made you know so he knew them so well and everyone has their their feelings about it and it's like any,
family it's so private how people feel about what's happened to their family members so I I never want to presume on,
their behalf but how I saw it yeah I did I felt you know there was a very clear,
sense that she never really committed to her art in the way that he did um and that therefore she was sort of able to,
kind of give her life over to him but that the the Betrayal for her was nothing to do with sex or infidelity it,
was to do with her being essentially his Muse Mentor best friend guide closest,
Confidant and the moment that he turned to somebody else for that and in the film he you see he goes to Tommy he goes,
to Gideon Glick and in this moment where he's very very nervous because he's you know previewing his F his his sort of,
new piece of work he reaches for Tommy's hand and that's the bit that it's not about anything except you know what's,
the point of her existence if she's not that person anymore right and the scene,
when you're having lunch afterwards and you're like say went on that date and thought he was asking you out and it's,
just getting closer and closer to your face oh my God yeah don't you love it when that happens yeah yeah feel the,
camera coming in like it's brilliant Margo one of the things I really want to know about on,
Barbie is the pitching of it you produced it um in a lot of ways it feels like kind of miracle that this movie got,
made in the way that it did and sort of as subversive as it is can you sort of take us inside the room when you were,
talking with Warner Brothers and Mattel particularly about those scenes where you're going to be making fun of Mattel,
in the movie what did that look like yeah the strategy was you know obviously it was a long process to to first get,
the property then get it um you know set up at Warners and Mattel and have everyone trust in us as a production,
company to make it and honor the brand but also do something relevant and interesting one of the biggest fights,
was convincing everyone that it could be a full quadrant movie because it had you know a budget that necessitated it being,
a four quadrant movie and that means getting men to go see it and everyone was just like there's just no way men,
are never ever young or old are never going to go see a Barbie movie and we're like but men will go see a great movie,
if it's great everyone will go see it people couldn't get past that but then there was also the stage of yes once had,
the script and it was like really going for it I think the strategy I said was,
let's just get all comfortable with being very uncomfortable so every time it was like tell me your concerns I,
totally hear you I see why that is making you uncomfortable but that's what we're going to do and we're just going,
to have to get comfortable with that feeling and it was always just like just get it to the next stage like get it to the next stage before you know it we be,
on set and then you know Greta said like you know the whole approach was like drive it like you stole it and that,
defin definely was the it definitely was the approach we were just like we just got to keep going going going don't let,
them stop us and um yeah it was it was it was an amazing process and everyone,
to their credit did get really comfortable with being uncomfortable I mean Mattel's literally a character in it and um was it always will thorough,
yeah there was a lot of like all the casting choices were very definite and everyone was so on board for like yeah,
doing it yeah it was so when you say okay it's going to be a boardroom full of men they're going to be having a tickle fight and this is how we're going,
to show your company they were down yeah and I also like you know when you're when you're trying to get a project up,
and running as those at the table who produce know it's like you're just like you're in selling mode I was like,
pitching it I was like I think my I was like if you pair like when you pair Spielberg with Dinosaurs what do you get,
a billion dollars you pair Greta and Bobby you're going to make a billion dollars,
you God cuz I was like God I hope this works out I've just promised everyone a,
billion dollars I really hope it does that but you know it's just you just have to like double down I I I think as,
a producer you got to like make your choices and then you back that choice like when you pick a director you don't,
hedge your bets and like believe in 90% of their ideas it's like no you I I will,
bleed myself out before I tell a director they can't have something they need I'm like if that's what you need for this then like let me go get like,
I'll make that happen that's that's like your job so there was a lot of just completely doubling down on some crazy,
big bold ideas does pitching feel like auditioning or does it feel like something,
different oh that's an interesting question no,
because it doesn't it feels like selling it feels like I'm a con man or something like I'm a a con artist like convincing,
everyone that something insane is actually going to work whereas audition feels like I don't know the funny thing,
I'm not I'm not good at lying and um people are like don't you lie for a living and I'm like oh I've never seen,
acting as that like I feel like acting is making something so incredibly truthful and like making it sound like,
the most honest thing that could ever come out of your mouth that's what acting is to me so actually I don't think it's lying whereas pitching I feel,
like it's not lying either but it's a lot of promising something you don't actually,
know well you've got a good track record of deling now so it makes it easy the next time you fit something you can,
point to it and be like see that worked out Annette I know that when you were,
training for niad you trained for a year there were days where you were swimming 5 hours a day wow why did you feel that,
level of commitment was necessary what what and how did it help um well I um I,
read the script and I just loved it I just was completely into her the whole,
story I didn't really think about the swimming which is so strange but CU I just loved it and I it was just,
like so I said yes and then I realized wait a minute bathing suit oh wait a,
minute I'm in a bathing suit I'm 60 something like what about that and then I have to do all the swimming you,
bathing soon well I I did cross my mind you know wasn't until later anyway so,
and I you know I I've always been a a person who worked out exercise for my brain as much as my bod um but I and I,
was a diver when I was a kid I was a scuba diver and I was in the ocean a lot I worked on a boat I'm very comfortable,
jumping in the ocean and all of that but I had never been a swim or swimmer you know so I had to learn and when I first,
got in I my impulse was because it was early on in the process I thought I'm just going to start swimming like I have,
a pool and I'm just going to jump in how you know would how hard can it be I was,
really naive I was completely you know it was it was overwhelming and I I really got scared and I thought what,
have I done wait a minute I've agreed to this wait can I do this um and I have to,
make it look right and does that work how's that going to work and you know I just went through all of that and I I,
talk about that because I I just I don't know I think a lot of us deal with those kinds of fears in a way and and we have,
to you know you have to face your fears in a way in the work in a good way like if you're lucky enough I hired a great,
coach she's an Olympian swimmer her name is Raa Owen and you know I took a deep,
breath and I she said okay show me okay you know and I did like my version of,
whatever I thought that was of freestyle and she's like oh yeah we can make this work and so she because of her,
disposition because of her nature she was a great swimmer she also still loves to swim many great athletes burn out on,
their sport whatever it is just because they've just done it so much but she's tall and she got in the pool with me and,
just immediately started showing me you know what what the technique was and,
that is an interesting process anytime physically you're learning a new uh,
skill because of course the experts know how to break it down well you know the breathing is here and it's only this,
much and then the arm goes here and the legs is very little and you know there's this whole thing and of course as a,
beginner you're thinking about 25 different things which you cannot do the only thing you can do really is think,
about one thing at a time actually so that takes then it's the practice and of,
course what happens with swimming is that you start to fall in love with it because it makes you feel so good it's,
so good for the central nervous system I'm pretty uh I have a very like active mind and a lot of exercise has always,
been for me to try to calm my mind so I I began to feel the benefits physically,
as well as emotionally and physically then we started talking about Diana what is her stroke like you know I had to,
learn to breathe on the left because she breathes on the left the boat has to be here Jody's there playing Bonnie my,
coach in the movie and so we started working on the more you know on that I have to breathe to left and I just,
worked really really hard and the more I got into it the more I enjoyed it then Diana came over to my house I got to,
know her spend time with yeah I got to know her very well she's a really interesting woman and uh if she was here,
she would be the most interesting person in the room she's just is she's just one of those people and she's extraordinary,
and she earned it you know she had to she had to earn that in life which is what I love about her um anyway so I did,
get to know her very well and then I did she did come over and I was nervous okay now I'm going to swim for Diana although,
they did put me on video you know because there's like people somewhere out there who are like how's she doing,
with the swimming and it's like they so they she did video me so they were like but she came to watch you she did she,
came to my house and I was like okay here it is did she give notes she you know what that's a good question I don't,
remember her giving nose I remember she had some ideas about training and stuff but no she just immediately was like oh,
Annette I'm so happy and I was wearing her swimsuit and she liked that and ni you know she's a very very dear person,
and she's she's a badass and she's smart and funny and just Unapologetic about,
who she is as a human being and she earned that you know now she's 74 and she she's you know but but she's a,
remarkable person yeah I love her I'm an ask a few just light and Breezy,
questions with the little time that we have left and one of them is what's it like when your parents see your,
performance oh God my parents came to see Maestro uh the London Film Festival,
um uh with my brother and my sister-in-law and we're all on a WhatsApp chain and um and I was in I,
came into London I didn't go to anything but I came in to see The Bernstein kids and have dinner with them whilst it was playing so I was at a restaurant and I,
was waiting for the finished you know film to finish so that I could you know see what they were going to say and I,
was at this restaurant and I said you know I've got the table from whatever just you know I'll order some food,
whatever and um I'm waiting waiting and then you know someone says I think the film must be over by now and I'm like,
okay um and then suddenly my phone lights up and it's the family WhatsApp group and I'm like oh,
okay and my sister-in-law just says Owen my brother wants the steak,
freed I was like oh okay cool um that was the I was like,
guys um but they came and they were lovely and whatever but it's you know it's I think it's just my you know I'm,
I'm 25 to 57 in Myro and for my mom to watch that mustard first of all I look,
like my mother in the later scenes when I have like the Prosthetics on and I'm playing Felicia older but I think for,
her it just must to be like you know and upsetting and weird and sad and I mean I'm for sure very proud and you were,
English so but um they sound Korean to me very similar and the WhatsApp too,
that whole infrastructure sounds very familiar my parents they obviously knew for months that I was doing this movie,
in Korean and that you know I was nervous about it and felt you know I had to step up to do it and then the trailer,
came out and I sent it to my parents and I got a text from my mom that was like,
oh my God it's in Korean and I was like yes I've been telling you for months and,
you didn't it's like you didn't believe me that it was actually going to be in Korean but then I realized for them to,
process like what that is was really jarring they could not accept that it was actually going to be in Korean um,
and they're you know normally very maybe stoic or just you know they've seen the things that I've done but it's never,
really been part of our relationship to be overly celebratory about certain things but I I have to say though after,
my mom went to see past lives and afterwards she she was sobbing and I've,
never I don't even know if I've seen her cry before and I was deeply,
uncomfortable with what was happening but she was she was a wreck and and I in,
that moment you know it was a Premiere I didn't feel like we could really get into it and of several days pass and she,
called me and she said I'm driving she said I'm still crying I'm like God,
what's wrong is everything okay and she said she said um I'm Nora oh oh my God,
yeah and I was like what and she said you know in her way she said you think this movie is about you but it's about,
me but behind that was a real sense of seeing,
herself that I really did not expect and that I mean yeah and that now I do I,
feel like I know her in a different way um it's a gift to take your mom on an emotional Journey like that through your,
work that's that's incredible yeah what did your parents say I I mean,
my dad has just always put it in my head that this is what I was going to do all my parents have always been I know it's,
I mean I owe them everything so I grew up rural Montana on a reservation it's like the world is telling you it's,
impossible for you and your access to the outside world when you're Liv remotely as film as TV is all of it I,
don't know I just kind of always had a certainty about it and yet I love it that a lot of the stuff that I do maybe,
it wouldn't be like the choices my dad would make for me and I don't think he always sees or appreciates what I do my,
mom does but um my dad in a way of like not giving me critique but also giving,
me praise he just he says that film was so profound yet very simple that film,
was he will pick the two contradicting phrases and say both and just like beautiful I mean it is but it's also him,
just being like he doesn't know what the the movie is about covering his b but he's uh even so,
like so your parents like know film enough like their film people enough,
that they could appreciate a sces film you know like I remember telling my I'm like it's scores and they're all like,
right well your family like doing a schoy film I mean yeah my dad's favorite movie is kundun that was my introduction,
to Marty I had no idea about like Good Fellas or anything um I hadn't I hadn't,
watched that Marty um yeah it's uh and my grandma even that was my grandma was,
born and raised in a like little Log Cabin she was born during the Depression on the on the NES purse reservation in,
lap way um premature you know like just survived All Odds but she loved movies,
she was around when we told her that I'd gotten cast in this my grandma like she went and saw a taxi driver in the,
theater when it came out in the 70s you know like loved film and she CED at me,
like Shirley Temple I think a lot of Grandma's from the 30s you know it's like like I said Res Kids a lot of times,
like our our out our view of the outside world is first shaped by like Cinema but,
we told her like yeah I'm going to be in Martin Scorsese film Oh Martin scorsi,
with Robert dairo oh Robert DeNiro and Leonardo,
Dicaprio and then I pulled Titanic out of her collection oh that's amazing wait can I ask,
something really quickly now that we're all best friends and I want to steal all of your secrets um in terms of Duality,
I'm I'm so curious to know what you guys I think about comedy and drama like and,
that the the difference is and if you approach it differently how you think,
about that I I just right it's it's the,
hardest I think really hard it's like super hard but I heard this thing I I,
just heard Matthew mccon and I don't I don't know if we're allowed to bring up men but here but I heard him say this,
thing about how he approaches drama like a comedy and comedy like drama which I thought,
was really interesting um and I I feel like I'm getting asked this a lot in,
terms of like how do I how do you like reconcile the two um genres and style,
and in terms of tone and pacing and I I just I'm curious if any if like what,
what do you think about that do you I do think comedy is harder definitely harder,
than than drama I feel less scared that I'm going to pull off like a big,
screaming crying scene than I am that I'm going to pull off a funny scene yeah like I'm like I know I can scream and,
shout and cry and do all that stuff but like can I make people laugh I don't know but I think it requires the same,
level of commitment that that like it's all in because if you take even an inch off the pedal there it's like going to,
fall flat on its face it's interesting that mccon quote though like that is kind of yeah I was thinking about like,
comedy being I mean comedy being tension and timing and and then thinking about,
the most dramatic scenes that that's also true that that inherent sense it's,
like a tickle that it's hard to explain but it feels for me the time it's time like comedic timing is so such a thing,
that I feel like you don't have to be quite so spot on with the timing when it comes to drama but I feel like you do,
and when I watch your work I feel that same sense of timing of tension timing,
of of it's almost like playing to a live audience where there's you because you,
are when you're in a when you're in a scene with someone you're in the same way as like a conversation with someone,
you're you're feeling out what is going to happen next what's coming from them,
like you were saying reacting you're yeah you're watching someone move and,
you're responding as such and in that sense I feel like comedy and drama are the same and life is constantly,
encapsulating both yeah like something that's just serious and never has levity does not make sense to me because when,
someone's dying you find a reason like everybody bursts into laughter because the tension's so high at a certain point,
or they like it it always lives in tandem yeah but I agree with you I think the timing is constant whether it's you,
know called comedy or drama it's always like Revelation I feel like in drama,
like the revelation of an emotion is where you get some of the catharsis and maybe the audience comes along for it,
and the same with a joke a revelation is almost like a punch line yeah speaking of timing we do have to wind down um is,
it something we said it is if this were up to me we would be here all day but I know that you can't do that um what is,
the most used emoji on your phone one good I think mine's the brain,
explosion one mine's the melting Smiley I love the melting Smiley it's really,
helpful and the smiley with the sunnies I do a lot too yeah mhm there's also one that's like that oh yeah I love that one,
what's this one mean the up circle like people go like this what does that mean I thought it's,
used in tandem with the X like it's an XO oh oh I feel adorable I don't know,
but there's also just an XO isn't there like X and an o i I never know what it means when you when you I like send a,
text to someone and they'll go just do it to them Ma like you're you,
made a goal I know or like I don't know or I have no idea I've become a fan of,
the sparkly the sparkly yeah the Stars like the three little stars that's that's a good frame coming around to,
head yeah it's like a good frer for the for the Jack it's a nice the Emoji is the art the Sparkles or the,
frame do it h let's do it h to you ladies thanks yall so so much Che,
cheers Che thank you very much for having us well that hour flew by but,
we learned so much guys I mean from P to a 5-year-old about what you really do for a living to the most used emojis on,
their phones wow oh that's right we also talked about acting too until next time I'm Ivan orgy and this has been off,
I think Final Cut Is is an attitude it's a state of mind I mean I wasn't going to be making films I was only making films,
I felt passionate about if I feel passionately about it then it's going to have to be yeah this way this way if you,
don't want to make this film don't make the movie but this is the movie I'm making you know if you do want to make it let's go you know financi Final Cut,
is a state of mind that is the t-shirt that is the T-shirt love welcome to offs script with,
The Hollywood Reporter I'm your host Ivan orgy here at the gorgeous Georgian hotel in Santa Monica California for,
years The Hollywood Reporter has brought the film industry's top creatives together for inspiring and surprising,
conversations and today is no different when it comes to film making from the very first action to the final that's a,
cut it's all about bringing the director's Vision to life and today you're about to hear from six Visionary,
directors who made some of this year's most talked about films that's right today we have Blitz bazle of The Color,
Purple Bradley Cooper of maestro AA duen of origin Greta Gerwig of Barbie Todd,
Haynes of May December and Michael man of Ferrari normally they're behind the,
camera but today they're on the record and just a little off script with The Hollywood Reporter hey Rebecca they're,
all yours thanks Ivon we're here with The Hollywood Reporter director's Roundtable how do you guys like to start,
do you actually call Action Greta what's your preferred way of diving into a scene um I guess I say when you're ready,
um it's I it seems less aggressive maybe I was directing,
said something more yeah you usually usually it's the sun's going,
down does anybody else like to like a more kind of action forceful no I would,
say action yeah I don't I don't even yell at on set like I the first ad does that like I,
just whisper and like and and and often I'm also like so nervous that I I don't,
want to like transfer that energy into so I just go somebody's job to just be The Confident one like I'm just going to,
be here looking at his monitor going please work I call Action um or I have action,
called it took me a long time in my film making to feel confident not to be the,
one calling action MH because you know I thought I need to be doing it and now I'll just tap my ad and he or she'll do,
it um but but I find it important to do because there's more than the actor who,
is working in that moment and that you need to call attention to everyone on the crew that we are now focused stop,
and now we're going to we're going to look here and so uh I like to do it what about you no I I I do it because I feel,
like the actors appreciate a moment of just Collective,
okay the energies can can align and we can all be in sync with each other you,
know but it it should be gentle of course do you what do you do brother well I think because uh I'm in the movie,
uh I have a a leg up in that way that I could I'm I have more S tools to create an environment so actually I have hand,
signals with the sound mixer and the camera operator and I I don't call Action and I'll sort of everything after,
everything's set up I'll just sort of start talking and bring the actors and often they don't they don't know rolling,
and then they're like the scene's over and they're like huh I sort of try to do that so it's and,
also I'm I'm the I'm Lenny so it's not like uh I'm not breaking in and out of character so I really it's really kind,
of I can I have a much more ability to like create this illusion you know so,
it's a it's it's uh it's easier so you stayed in character in between takes yeah so Leonard Bernstein was directing,
everybody leard yeah I mean I I would go I would show up with Kazu here the makeup artist at like one a and then,
Lenny would be done before crew call and then and then I would yeah it's Lenny all day dep and then he was different,
ages so the crew was like oh we got young Lenny it's going to be a quick day old Lenny it's like oh here we go he's,
going to walk from there to there you know it was it was crazy yeah I was so naked it felt like and I was the first,
day the first scene we shot was when old Lenny teaching William uh conducting and,
um but that was a great ice breaker because I just thought are they all gonna because I have to that was the first that yeah the first was the was,
the was the Jaguar pulling up that was the first actual setup and then we went inside and did that scene yeah oh my God,
so that was crazy and um it was baptism by fire and but I it was beautiful because I was so naked I I felt so,
vulnerable I remember really feeling like are the crew going to start laughing at me because I'm you know and they didn't and and really in that that,
first day we all sort of came together and I felt like it was just a beautiful like you know there's no I don't there's,
no chairs there's no video Village on the set so it's just everybody's right there and they don't leave and uh it,
just felt be it was like oh we're a troop yeah what how important is it choosing what your first um scene that,
you're going to shoot is how does that sort of set a tone what goes into the thinking Ava what was your what did you,
start with uh on Origin gosh I I remember about an hour into the first day I thought why why did I choose of,
course it was a matter of location availability and it just I I couldn't dictate it was a purely a logistics,
decision um but it was the day that I woke up that morning first morning,
Monday uh 400 a.m call uh for a thousand,
background actors to Hy Hitler oh God and I thought you know what let's just,
start it off let's just do this and so it was the morning and it just so much,
so many background actors that action that intention uh was the first thing we,
did wow and and in some ways the film is what it wants to be and and uh it set a,
tone for the uh the seriousness of the subject matter the intention with which,
we're going to work throughout the production and that oh this is really about something that we need to keep our eyes on for the whole crew I'm not that,
concerned with the first day I'm what I'm concerned with is when in the schedule I want to have the most pivotal,
and important Saints and so for me is that's usually around week four or five because regardless of how much we've all,
prepped you learn about making the film organically and emotionally intuitively,
as you go and so you know more about making this for for everybody those it's,
the scene when um when Enzo and Lara have their big blow up and then of course the last scene in the film which,
is which is key so I wanted those scenes to be in about week four I wanted to do,
all the car work in the beginning and get it out of the way so we could rink wrapped down into a smaller unit that's,
very organic and suit the dramatic seeds and of course it did not work out that way at,
all so we wound up doing all the dramatic seeds first and I I was going to say I thought you did the cars last,
right that's how that's why we W up doing the cars last and they were done quickly like everything in the mountains,
was shot in one day wow wow one day my God which was crazy that's crazy did you,
have many cameras going many unit like how did you do that yeah you talk very,
quickly W so yeah no we had no it was just one unit I have B I don't have I,
don't have second unit so I like split off in B camera sometimes we just did it's just very very planted everything,
was planned and know Greta what's the day that you were sort of moving toward,
was it was there a particular scene that you had in your head I I tend to like to shoot the beginning of the movie at the,
end because you you're not so tense about it I mean you know you you have some ease with it um,
but on this one we actually shot the whole beginning of it in the beginning,
and it was like a it was like a silent film that was unfolding because was the whole wakeup sequence and everyone was,
in their own strange houses and it was and it so it was like a week of like a,
silent movie um which was great because then there were lots of words after that,
um but every everyone became very in sync and everyone everyone on the crew it was everyone was like a dancer um,
sound and camera and everyone was that makes makes total sense because the opening is fantastic the camera just,
moves around you understand the entire culture of Barbie's World and um you,
know in just in one whole set of moves it was a it was it was a you know I'm,
everyone here it was a I had the most wonderful Dolly grip you know when someone is like they just and and he was,
best friends with Margot um I mean really their best friends so they had a short hand so he would know,
when she was going and then they could run at high speeds together later it was like a I was like this is every act lead,
actor should be best friends with a dolly grip this is a this is a critical thing and then you know Rodrigo was is,
so great with his team but I think so I start I started with the beginning and then I think um for us I think the thing,
that I I I wanted to hold to the end was actually sh in Los Angeles because,
everything about this movie was so absurd and heightened and I felt like we had to stay in this protective world as,
long as we could and um so then La went at the end which was correct there are,
so many moments where I'm amazed what you got away with um in a wonderful way and I was wondering if there are moments,
that you're amazed that you got away with yes there are many moments I'm amazed that I got away with there's just,
some very obscure your jokes which I can't believe are in the movie like a PR,
Barbie joke that's a really that was I don't know I heard one woman in New York laugh at that joke I thought oh about,
that's for you um there's a Steven malcolmus pavement joke which I was like,
that's a deep cut even you know and and things like that what there's a dream,
ballet of Ken's I things like that I it's there's a there's a ton of stuff in,
it you know when you make strong stylistic choices which is true of everyone at this table it's like you,
kind of have to get behind it 100% because you're like well I I guess I'm doing it this,
way I I don't have another way and then you think well maybe I should have covered myself too late now it's this,
and I think that that's like a but there's sort of freedom in realizing there's no way there's no you're just,
going to do like you're going to do it in one shot or this is going to go into is this dream sequel like there's these,
kind of moments where you're like I guess I've committed you know and a crew feels that yes yeah Todd there's a scene,
early in May December that feels to me like it really defines the tone for the movie and I'm sure people have asked you,
about it when Julian Moore opens the fridge and says there's not enough hot dogs and you have this dramatic zoom and,
the score changes I just want to know what what were you thinking in terms of setting the tone and and particularly,
about that scene well that scene sets up this whole barbecue sequence when,
Natalie Portman is coming to for the first time to introduce herself to the woman she's gonna study to play in a in,
a film um but the thing that I was thinking about when every was talking about their first days is the music that,
we used in the film was in inspired by a Michelle gr score from uh Joseph losy,
film The go between from 1971 incredible film that's sort of,
fallen out of circulation not something you see much in the United States very,
hard to even get on DVD I saw it on TCM When I Was preparing my image book for May December and I knew May December,
needed a very strong tonal frame uh to sort of create this sense,
that you're really questioning what you're watching all the way through and it entices the viewer into that,
discomfort of H feeling the ground shift beneath you which is really what happens throughout the,
film and so I thought okay this music is We also had we had 23 days to shoot the,
movie in Savannah Georgia wow so everything had to be so meticulously planned and it meant though that it was,
like what you were saying you bring everybody in to this adventure these,
risks that you're taking as a director these choices that you're taking as a director but it doesn't work unless you're all that's right sharing that,
concept so that music the score from that film became my example of what I,
wanted to do with the score very bold very in-your-face score that sits right in front from the very beginning and so,
the very first setup we did just Natalie bortman driving up to the community center where she does a flower,
arrangement scene with Julian and um right away I was like hit,
it Ben my assistant and all of a sudden we go d d this music and the whole crew was like,
wait what is what movie are we making and we played the cues to this,
other score through the entire shooting of the movie but it put us all in the,
same tonal space you know and then it was ultimately something I I had to have,
my composer adapt but that scene with that with just a Sting from that score,
that marks that moment with the refrigerator sets up a a tonal MH you know freedom I think a relaxation that,
there's going to be humor against this very dark story but I try to have the music ahead of time and because become,
become as you're talking about kind of a poetic modular and so what is this scene about again a certain emotional quotient,
that I can't put in the words and if you have one piece of music for a pivotal scene for the whole thing for me that's,
kind of a kind of a poetic modular for something and I try to have it head of time that's no surprise for how the,
music works in your from the very beginning Blitz I I heard you say that,
when there was first discussion of making the color purple as a movie your thought was why but obviously you,
ultimately became persuaded what was it that persuaded you well it was actually,
going back to Alice Walker's words you know her brilliant pit prizewinning book and those first words the God you know,
for me were like the the anchor cuz immediately I understood that whoever writes led us to God has an imagination,
period and then I kind of started to break through that and go well if they have an imagination how wide can we push,
this idea of this imagination and the throughout the challenge was how do you not be,
redundant you know for for a a piece of material that's been this explored and,
and and we all know all its minations what are you actually going to contribute so that was my big Challenge,
and so once I found this idea of this imaginative space then it became about,
what are the elements that are going to help us explore them better and some of them were visual some of them were Sonic,
um but also I also kind could think about myself and go you know when I,
think about people who are have dealt with trauma and abuse you know they often miscategorized this you know being,
docile or waiting to be saved I think nothing could be further from the truth it's really people who are in their,
heads trying to figure out how to work their way out and so and I grew up around many people like this you know,
some in my family right and so I knew very quickly that you know that pathway was going to open up so much opportunity,
for us to actually contribute to the cannon and and I'm so thankful that I,
was allowed to push forth um I remember our very first day was our our two girls,
netti and and cely and I wanted to begin there because I wanted to begin in a,
space of innocence and a place of Beauty for for the whole cast you know just to,
go and then the crew to go whatever happens here whatever Darkness we're going to kind of go through we're going,
to find light at the end you know and so we begun with this beautiful wide epic of like Savannah Driftwood Beach it's,
like gorgeous the sun's out and we do this amazing mov and the craziest thing,
the first shot of the first day is in the movie you know I mean which that's which is rare you know but but it was it,
was so we was all so ready and we were we all wanted to just live in this beautiful world that these girls were,
going to go in and how it'll turn dark but know that we're going to find our way back out of it so yeah I mean once,
that day was over I was just like I can exhale I feel like I feel like I know what I'm doing I feel like I can handle,
this scope and uh yeah it just just kept going from there Ava the book that,
Origins based on is this incredible um sort of Scholastic book cast by Isabelle,
werson it is not in any way an obvious cinematic adaptation to me when I read it I maybe would have seen a docu series,
you went a whole other way with it where did you get the idea to to frame it the way that you did well I read the book,
The First Time and didn't understand it and that frustrated me I read it again,
and I started to kind of get a feel for it and by the third time I read it I thought people need to know this,
information and i' had done 13th before and had considered doing it as a docu series but I know that um the the,
characters they started to call to me because there are characters within this non-fiction book uh embedded in the,
historical tales that the author shares one I talked about my first day was all,
of these background act actors highing Hitler the way reason we staged that scene is because there was one man,
August landmesser who refused to Hile and I thought oh I want to know more about his life and so there's nothing,
else about him so I had to research that shoot that put it on its feet and bring actors in to flesh out his life and the,
life of his his spouse and so those characters throughout history that the author references um I wanted to animate,
them with real life with flesh and bone on them but also when you're thinking about the structure I said is this crash,
is this like a bunch of stories kind of together that touch a bit just,
tangentially um or could I find a character that delivered it to us and um,
when you read the book really closely you see Isabelle the author she's speaking in her voice she is discovering,
she is the delivery system and when I researched her even further she lost people in her life within a 16-month,
span while she was writing the book now that's a character and that is someone that I want to get to know someone that,
I feel empathy for someone that I want to deliver this information for us and so so um it's an unadaptable book um and,
uh that's always the kind of books you want to adapt um that's that's kind of the things I go for but you know it was,
uh a film that I feel every film that I made up until this point led me to it,
had historical aspects that I had I had uh practiced in Selma has blurs the line,
between documentary and narrative which was the 13th was a big part of that when they see us dealing with the sprawling,
cast and and and a bunch of different different story lines there's a a,
quality with Isabelle's character where she's often having to persuade skeptical people about her book and I wondered if,
there was any of you in that in having to persuade skeptical people about your idea yes yeah did I say I made it,
independently yes um yes yes it really was I mean this isn't the kind of film,
that you take to a studio and say can you give me millions of dollars to make a story about a woman who's going through a trauma and through that trauma,
writes a book about very dense subject matter that she believes will save Humanity um there's no actual enemy or,
antagonist the antagonist is all of us like that pitch meeting doesn't go well at the studios um and so we just didn't,
do it we just decided to take that off the table and not ask for something that,
I already knew you know not ask may I cast and new Ellis may I may I cast her,
will you accept that I cast this woman that you do not think is going to bring in butts and seeds can I populate this,
with the actors that I love and not that are on your list you know can I I want,
to go and shoot in Delhi I want to go to Berlin we only have 37 days I know that,
but I'm going to do three countries in 37 days you know the kinds of things that the studios will just it just does,
not happen they won't allow it and so sometimes you just don't ask and so that,
that that's what we did so there wasn't a lot of nose and also I I just surround myself with people who saw me reaching,
for something and who supported that you know there was one friend of mine who I,
leaned on so heavily in this his name is gal Del Toro he got me through this I,
get emotional he got me through this you know what I mean he got me through this from the script when people were saying,
I don't get it he was like you migga keep going keep going you must just with,
the fervor the like okay I'm going to keep going and every step on the way call me during the week check on me,
casting I heard about this came into the editing room just pop up and be like what are you doing here gdt just coming,
to hang out let's let's see what's going on you know and just really that friend,
who said this is untraditional this is a little different but you you deserve space to do that you,
can do it too keep trying keep pushing so I think the answer to the question is um yes there were a lot of people saying,
no but I surrounded myself with the people who said try try and uh and that kept me going does that resonate for,
anybody yeah yeah everybody said no to Maestro yeah,
every Studio passed um Studio I had made so many movies with that were that were also big risks that worked out and,
luckily Scott stuber man one guy he said look I trust you it's crazy a movie,
about a fluid male character who's classical musician and half it in black and white and you're going to shoot it on 35mm black and white stock so I can't,
change it and he said yeah and that was um and then I just surrounding myself with people luckily GMO also always,
there what a beautiful man beautiful one can I do a segue real quick because I wanted to get it in here because I'm try,
not to get emotional but you know I've been an actor for so many years still an actor and one thing I learned from this,
man was I put myself on tape for Public Enemies years and years ago and I didn't,
get it and he wrote me a letter I got a letter from Michael man saying thank you for,
auditioning and you know I I see something in you and I kept that on my bookshelf for so many,
years and you know you never know the impact you have wow wow and and and I learned from that and anybody that,
auditions I always write them and that's because of you it's so hard I can't imagine putting myself in the position,
of actors who come in I know but you're Michael man you know so it's like beautiful lesson,
is this the Michael man uh tribute section because I just have a quick I have a if I may so Michael and I,
have a special relationship because Michael is the reason that I thought,
that I could become a filmmaker Michael man I was a publicist on the fil his,
film collateral and I was a one of the the group of unit publicists and uh had,
always been on sets and seen things happen but i' never seen anyone shooting,
in communities of color in Los Angeles where I was from collateral also had a,
cast of people who looked like me I know everyone thinks Tom Cruz but J Jada,
pinket and Jamie Fox and Javier BM as well as Mark ralo were also in that film,
and Michael was shooting in East LA he was shooting in South Central he was shooting in the communities that I grew,
up in and he was shooting with these new Fang cameras called digital cameras I,
said God these are fast what is he doing and he's moving around and he's doing his thing and just watching him being on,
that set as a young publicist made me think wait he's shooting with black and brown people in black and brown,
communities with cameras that are fast like I'm going to look into this and just seeing the way that he controlled,
the set and really was so Visionary and what he wanted it's a great incredible film and so all throughout my you know,
Sundance all my journey people say how did you get into this I always speak his name I always say Michael Michael what,
is it like for you to know about the impact that these choices that you've made in your career have had on it's a,
surprise is it yeah absolutely because you know to me I'm just I I pretty much,
occupy a present looking to the next thing I want to do that just you know go forward but the as I was saying I just,
the uh when actors actors come in they put their you know their heart and soul out there and or something and it it's,
such a difficult position um that's what motivated me to this was a small role,
very small role wasn't like you know wow thank you anyway I think it's,
important because I think you you you have a reputation in this business as a hard-nosed guy and to me,
just a teddy bear she's ruining your r don't tell,
anybody I didn't realize until yesterday that aray Ava company had released,
blitz's movie about five years ago so there's a lot of connections here I mean,
I say thank you to you all the time but you know I'll take this opportunity to say since it's we're giving flowers um,
"you know it's it's I I went to Ghana $40,000 because nobody would would even",
look or think that I I had the ability ility or or it was even worth exploring,
an African filmmaker making a movie in his country I'm a musician so I went on,
tour played as every hole in the wall I could find saved every every penny I,
made went to Ghana um with a community who had never made a feature film before,
we all learned I remember we were on YouTube going like what does a what does a first ad do like no one knew anything,
about anything we made this film and then it came about you know these these lofty goals of maybe it'll go to Khan,
maybe it'll go to Venice you know and none of that happens so then you go well I got to take it to every small film,
festival in the world and I played Urban world and and word got out um and and,
aa's amazing company uh array were like I see something here it became gh's,
first film to be on Netflix cuz that's what Beyonce saw um and called me to do,
black as king with her wow and once I did that and and with each one was just,
learning experiences uh you know I did cherish the day again thank you for that because that was the first time I worked,
with with uh you know uh unionized crew and and all of that I knew nothing about,
any of that stuff and fast forward you know making the color purple you know,
how you go you don't know how you arrive at these places and you have no idea how each decision big or small affects your,
trajectory no one from where I'm from has ever made a studio picture like there's nobody to call to go hey you,
came from Ghana you came from Kenya you came from wherever talk to me about how you manage a studio relationship talk to,
me about and so we find ourselves in these you know pioneering positions that,
um you can only get here based on Goodwill kindness of heart you know what,
I mean of of of of people so I'm I'm I'm a deep beneficiary of your grace and and,
and your and I'm deeply thank and and I mean the the journey just keeps going I'm I'm amazed to be sitting,
at this table too with the likes I mean this is like you know an incredible table of brilliant brilliant artists and,
so yeah I'm I'm you know I could cry I know I don't cry don't cry you know directing,
is is is you're with this crew that you're doing it together but in a certain way it's can it's lonely or it's,
individual be lonely and um to be able to talk and to be together and I've you know had the privilege of you know,
running into you and you'd already directed something and then you tell me something and then we talk at a lunch in and I just like you see people and then,
you came to a dinner and it was and everybody's trading stories and there's something about it where it's not um,
it's not it's a it's a craft in that it's pasted person to person I really,
believe that that there's a way in which you you learn it from people and with people and I think the the community,
I've experienced of filmmakers is um it's it's it's really lifts you up and I,
G garmo being like the the person who's the most like generous generous man you,
know that's very true you you you you get a gift from some you pass it on these are things you just pass on it's,
very gratifying what you said now thank you when Blitz was talking about working with the studio I thought about,
something I've heard you say on Barbie which is that your motto was drive it like you stole it can you explain that,
what that means well I'm steing that it was yeah well it,
was actually I mean um Margot who I had as a producer She'll always you know say like does anybody have anything else,
they want to say and I was like they give us the yes Margot just leave the room we don't need to look for another,
thing let's just go but I but I did feel like you'd get the yes and just just keep going I was actually feel like,
lucky because I feel like we were on Parallel tracks because you were in um the you were in a process of going green,
lighting and and working on it and I was sort of simultaneously and I'd never done a proper green light presentation,
and I was like what what did he do like what do we do what because you know you just you don't know it until you know,
know it and you can only be where you are and you you're learning everything,
as you go for me it's been lucky within the studio in terms of uh people have,
taken these big risks and gotten behind it and and said yes and even if it's,
uh yes then you're just like that's all I need I mean we were also pitching during Co yes I know like we were the,
you know I I was technically one of the first to pitch during Co yes and so my my co pitch became like we we started,
sharing it you know what I mean and and and and I saw your Co pit saw my pitch I saw your because I was like i' never,
seen a pitch and I was like what do people do and they were like and then I was like okay that's how we do it and,
you talked about magical realism and you had all these examples and I was like okay I got to get but You' you've never,
done it before how would you know what it's supposed to be I mean for me you had never done it I'd never done it how,
did your Co fin is this well well what it was was and you know for me like I'm really,
believe in showing don't tell like I really fundamentally believe that if you,
ever want to convince anyone to do anything talking is a waste of time just,
go this is a glass and this is water and you can see it that's it and they'll go,
yeah it's a glass it's water I see it and so I begin first with sketching I sketch everything like it doesn't matter,
and AA you know this like I'm a storyboard geek I will sit down and it helps me do a couple things it helps me,
go if I can see it and I if I can see it clearly and I bet you I can convince as,
many people to see it as clearly as possible and so going into that pitch I was like I can go in and I can talk,
about all these things I'm going to do I'm never going to get green lit but I you can go him and show him and guys we,
went in I found music I found I mean that thing was alive in the pitch deck,
it was like you know as I could I even got some previsit done just anything I could do to let everybody go because,
here's my other thing if you green like this yeah well that's what you green lit,
you you can't go back and go Blitz you you're doing all this no no no guys I told you what I was going to do I was,
doesn't that happen sometimes well it that the I mean you had a changeing regime at the studio right we did we did,
we're surv we did it we did it so one group of people said yes and then a new group of people is yes is releasing it,
and that double green light for starsour yeah they reg greenl for a new group of,
left and to came in same Studio we all but but here's the thing when you say drive it like you stole it I mean I woke,
up every day and again this is just part of it is just trauma of of seeing me so,
many people get close but never close and you find yourself in this position,
as a first and you go it's never happened for any of us so it probably can't happen for me so this anxiety,
around maybe if you just keep going like when and trust me there were phone calls,
about you know maybe we should and I no you know what I used to do I literally drove down to Savannah myself on my own,
dime and anytime I could feel the vibe around can we re consider I'll go here,
are some new videos I shot here's a new location I found oh Fatima just sent us this amazing uh uh dance choreography we,
should all look at it and it was just constantly going if I can just distract them and and with amazing stuff right,
we're just like it looks good guys it's happening oh here's a cast oh my goodness have you thought about this,
person oh and everybody gets excited SM man I mean it was and I also got to say,
and this is just being very transparent guys when we were even talking about our first days right you know a lot of us,
don't have the grace right where you're allowed to fail and flutter and find,
your footing my first 8s sent me the schedule and I looked at that stuff and I said guys if I commit to this schedule,
and I shoot these first five days I'll be out of here and it's not that I can't direct it's just that it's ordinary,
people talking and and and someone is going to go show a little rasle Dazzle,
I literally had to call Fa and go I know I'm about to put everybody in a crazy,
position I know you've got 100 dancers to get ready yeah but we're going in and,
we're going in these first three days we're going to do three of our biggest we shot the a huge massive dance number,
like day two I think it's important conversation the management of the people who have given you the millions,
of dollars to do the thing it's a big part of the directing that we don't talk about,
I I had I had one I've only had one movie in which I walked in so you know,
Michael when I don't want to do last moans great idea let's do it once right,
they just let you do how about Daniel de Lewis great idea let's go wow wow you're,
like really wait get shot right now so did you have to hard pitch heat no he he,
was different he I own I wrote the screenplay I had the screenplay got Bob got,
we yeah there was no development and the studio hated the fact that they liked it a lot and they had no control over it,
which is but this is exactly what you want that's what we like that was but can I ask who here had Final Cut on,
their film if you don't I I didn't I didn't you did I've never had Final Cut no neither independent you did yours,
independent no independent or not independent very but I did have an ace I did have an ace cuz I was like well I,
mean you could fire me or but like you got to recap as Lenny good luck,
dude you kind of have I I didn't think I was like I was like yeah I mean you can,
do it but good luck I've never actually I've never actually had CAU I've always,
had tiebreaker or whatever the language is but I always figure um the movies I've got gotten to release or the movies,
I wanted to release in every way but uh so I don't feel like it's you know been,
something where I'm like I would have done differently but um what you said also about like this what the studio,
looks at the first week I remember with Little Women I started doing it I was shooting all these like dark candlelit,
scenes and someone's like do not send them a bunch of underlit scenes and I,
was like that's right we got to change the schedule and do like girls at Christmas,
um because they're like that looks like what I thought it was going to be no one told me on Selma not to shoot first week,
David O yellow and Coleman Domingo in a jail sale in Selma Alabama lit by one,
street light through the window it's in the film it's Bradford young suit Stark my beautiful cinematographer on that,
shoted and we were like we're going to make it feel like the hole of a slame here you go here you go here you,
guys here's the dailies and literally they freaked out they made us re-shoot,
the scene no one told me this Greta to do the dance girls first and then do the,
Dan I mean but it comes from that trauma of going you know just you know for me I,
okay I was just so first of all I couldn't believe I was in this position which is it's just it happens you know I,
don't know you know on your first films right you you're you're waking up going how did I get here right it it always,
happens you know and then and and then and then the other part becomes if I don't these are survival mechanisms,
right just like straight up my concern is and this what happened when's those first week cuz they on you until that,
first week and then they go I think that's that's the movie we said and then and then literally I mean we were out,
doing crazy stuff after that I me we could do whatever we wanted but again I think that it really comes from like,
first of all just knowing a psychology around people who give you a lot of money to do anything right and I come,
from the music business you know I was a musician for like many years so like I I,
completely understood also just how to make it look like something you know because the music business really,
has no money it hasn't had any money for a long time but it always looks like something going to say but that's also,
the virtue of your approach because I I think that the the uh the more I can,
make them fully understand every single thought I have and every detail about how the movie is going to be it's both,
authentic and then there's no surprises also so it's um so depending on how you,
made your movie you have this sort of Commerce issue in the back of your mind I mean Todd how do you when you really,
need to be there for your actresses in this film I have to just I have to just,
thank my unbelievable Good Fortune of having Christine vashan at my side as my producer from my,
first feature film poison which was made sort of like an art project through Arts grants through the National Endowment,
for the Arts and New York State Council for the Arts and we did it like it wasn't likeing a movie with anybody,
looking over your shoulder and that was the orientation that I came out of as a filmmaker and the examples that inspired,
me to to take risks and not think about a commercial,
outcome and I've been lucky enough to just take those little steps toward like,
yeah you get we got a distributor for Poison the new queer Cinema the whole,
AIDS crisis was happening at the same time as my first feature film and it fueled why we were making the film to,
begin with but it also provided an audience for new and Innovative whatever,
you know kinds of film making and other filmmakers who would became part of that that whole,
company and so I've just I feel so lucky and protected that I've been able to,
keep working kind of in that artistic vacuum without that preoccupation with,
I'm so curious to hear if that's how you felt Michael cuz your your films were so,
absolutely distinctive from the very beginning they they they established,
themselves stylistically and tonally tonally with such force and such confidence but they were your lowest,
budget films obviously but you you built on them that's sort of how I feel I some,
somewhat how I've been able to build a career thanks I I think think I think Final Cut Is is an attitude it's a state,
of mind I mean I wasn't going to be making films I was only making films I felt passionate about if I feel,
passionately about it then it's going to have to be yeah this way this way if you don't want to make this film don't make,
the movie but this is the movie I'm making you know if you do want to make it let's go you know Financial Final Cut,
is a state of mind that is the that is the love that but you do,
need your to set it up with Partners even they're if they're producing Partners or actors who are guiding it,
that you know will listen to what you feel and it it is a real contractual,
commitment that you either have on paper or you don't it is also yeah or I was just going to say it is also just you,
can't fake it but like when you actually can say from within yourself I don't,
need to make a Barbie movie I'd like to make this one if you don't want to make it I don't need to make it um I didn't,
actually have final cut but I could had the T-shirt they knew they knew they knew,
sry I interrupt I was just thinking that like I actually um it forces you to double down on your point of view I,
found there's a part of it that I like I like the challenge I always found myself I had to keep saying like no I told you,
it's a movie about marriage and it's going to be one musical element that was the thing I said six years ago I've never been in an experience where I I,
have felt so a part of and so alone and depending on where I was in the film making process but but it really um you,
know for examp there's one scene where we shot was always going to be this thanks this big fight scene and it was always that you know and and I,
understand if you're the student you're like we're no coverage I was like that's it yeah,
that's it isn't it wonderful no coverage I was like yeah and and and it forced me,
to to actually even have to articulate why and I don't mind that I I I don't mind being challenged if I've done the,
work yeah I actually think that and sometimes you learn something you know but um I I actually don't mind not,
having Final Cup I didn't pay for the movie they did you know that's very clear to me it's like I didn't have that money they did and then and I respect,
that so they it is there for them but I have the power to say I'm walking away you know so I I yeah so it's like it is,
a state of mind because of course why would I spend this amount of time why would we all spend this much energy,
realize that we have a story to tell with you so Artic I love how you articulate why you made that movie then,
it's like that's your that's your anchor yeah that's that that's your you know that's a huge pillar that you could just,
wrap yourself around I I was going to say you you made,
the original Barbie movie This is the Karen Carpenter superar the Karen,
Carpenter did you see that Michael you ever seen it it's but it but it it's a wonderful,
thing that we're sitting at the table right now because I think I think it was genuinely you made them nervous about,
the possibilities um about what it could be and but I felt like it was um anyway,
it's very special that we are you kidding I mean I I mean my my use of Barbies was as a subtext yes you know to,
a story about how women's bodies are commodified and and and the story of,
this incredibly heartbreaking story of a young woman studing suffering from anorexia nervosa but you took on the,
cultural meaning of Barbie and you exploded it and you but also made it a,
confection that everybody could share but I would say your your movie and your,
response to it the way you used it was part of the cultural history of Barbie and it's in there and even if it's not,
uh forward it's part of it it's the way I think of it and so anyway it's just,
but yes I think they were like are you going to do that thing that he did you're like,
well does any anybody have a ritual that sets them up for the day yeah I've got,
I've got to I've got to work out I've got to run I've got to do something I Zone in the night before and then I have,
to refresh the prep and just be to totally focused and that usually comes,
for me for for me for whatever reason is I got to get my you know heartbeat up to 120 for 20 minutes and while it's in,
that state I that's what I Zone into what I'm going to do as an actor I used,
to always go to step before at crew call even even before my call time just cuz I just would love to I just loved the film,
making process so in this one and I always felt like a little goofy doing it and I was like what are you doing but I just wanted to do it and then this one I,
got to go to work like six hours before crew call because I would become Lenny before and I actually found that as a,
filmmaker was just invaluable that I was actually actively in a chair with Kazu,
and and I would just go through the whole day all the time you know and it was really I have to say it it made the,
shooting just that much easier uh and I wouldn't have thought of that but on this particular film it was a huge I,
think asset just for my clarity once I was there I love that that's got to be mesmerizing it really was it really you,
imagine all of us as directors like being forced to sit for two or three hours before a shooting day and have,
that time and that space like every day I I have a guitar and so like I I have,
to sit and I have to play and I have to imagine and I I I do a very similar,
thing um before anyone gets on my set even grips I'm like no you're not,
getting on my set before me that's right and I show up and I walk it and I walk it and I walk it quietly and I before,
the noise yes cuz boy when that noise starts oh boy it doesn't stop so I like,
to just kind of sit on the set with my guitar watch watch every corner of it go,
okay I know know where the drama is going to come from today I just need to be aware of it so I'm not surprised when,
it happens I go through the script and I and I and I visualize deeply you know,
what I mean how things are going to go and then and then and then they start pulling up and I go thank God I was here,
before everybody and I've also caught things I've caught things that weren't done before the day you know and I go uh,
guys we were supposed to take out that side of the wall not this side and thank God I'm here before every body else,
because it would have put another 2hour dent in our day right and so anyway like just being there early and and having my,
guitar and playing and and and just like quietly peacefully yeah before again the,
explosion happens you know what do you do I don't have a ritual I try to stay present in whatever,
the day is going to bring and that's always different you know the night before whatever has been done on set,
whatever interactions I've had affect the next day and it's a it's a a Continuum from one day to the other so I,
try not to uh I just personally don't I I don't have one how about you,
do you play the guitar what are you doing you swimming what's happening no I wish man what's going,
on no I just come as prepared as possible you know I do all my I do all my prep really in advance and then what,
was amazing about May December is that we had such a short amount of time to make it it happened very quickly the,
financing came to together quickly um another film I was doing fell,
apart and then all of a sudden the fall opened up and all of a sudden Natalie and Julianne had a overlap in the fall,
and we jumped at we also changed venues to Savannah the film has to take place,
in May because it's graduation month it was originally set in Maine Camp in Maine so there was no way to shoot,
anywhere in the East got it got it East Coast for May MH and I think because of,
the the energy and the and the and the sort of uh the combustion of that uh the,
velocity of it it meant that everybody was needed everybody was part of the of,
the discussion and it made for even though it was so tight and so,
and was so planned out every shot every you know no net we were flying without a,
net doing these single shot scenes and mirrors and all this stuff but it made for one of the most joyful,
experiences in a production and Productions can be brutal and they're marathons and they're tough but it was,
it was exemplary in that way it was really remarkable and when it ended I was like I don't know how it's going to,
come out well if I had this much fun making yeah,
that's my my rituals I I'm I'm I'm like a I'm like a major league baseball,
player who has to do the same things all the time like I'm and and then like a day went well then I'm like I got to do,
that again and so I have lots of things um on on Barbie um the week before we,
started uh uh Rodrigo prto who shot my film his wife Monica gave me a special,
stone that she said was magic and I was like but then I need it with me all the time and then I saw the other,
week and I was like tell Monica I still have this Stone and she's like you know,
you could put that down and so it's still I it's with me um um I have like I have to wear the same thing every day I,
learned how to do Transcendental Meditation because of David Lynch I've never gotten a vision like he has but,
I'm waiting meditate hold my stone have my outfit like I'm just like it's all it's,
like and at some point it's like if I could grow facial hair I'd like never I would just have a giant beard I feel,
like I'm it's like I I don't know it's it's all ritualistic the irrational objects are,
really interesting I've got an old aluminum clipboard that I've had for 40 years and I can't I don't know what,
would happen if I lost this it's been W over by trucks got to have that wow got to have,
that one thing you hold the clipboard throughout day absolutely everything the break down everything there got La the,
the dressing the same every day though like that that also became my thing first of all it was just super practical,
it was like I went to like H&M with the same black shirts went to Unique L got the same black pants like 20 of them it,
makes people comfortable when you show up every day like cuz they just go all right that guy seems to be a steady guy,
whether you are or not it feels like he's consistent film student in London I interviewed Stanley kubic a couple of,
times three times wow and every time I interviewed him he wore the same pants the same jacket and I said the third,
time I said you know Mr kuic I have to ask you why are you wearing the same clothes he says no I've got 30 of these,
pants and 30 of these jackets because I don't want to have to spend any energy thinking,
what wow get up and go and all ingar Bergman did was wear mismatched socks,
that was it that was it yes uh Berman have you gone to his house in in in fora,
it's a thing to see it's just there you can just go in it's just a house but it's also saved as it was wow uh there's,
so many amazing things but one thing is on the back of his office door he raided every single month of his relationship,
with leave om man even after they were divorced he he rated it some months got,
a heart and some months got a devil on the wall it's on the wall like,
and on on the back of the store every single month got just like here's how,
it's going um wow wild it's like it's it's actually I mean of like long,
marriages and artistic things that made I was thinking of that with your film of like just these these ins and like the,
just what it means to live a life and like grow into the same tree it's like,
but those artistic Partnerships anyway it's great it's um also he has um the de,
he has the VHS of Anor Management in his house that was his,
what yeah yeah he also has like you know other things but I was like he has anger,

good thank you I'm so excited that you all could be here such talented group of people I know some of you know each,
other some are probably just meeting today maybe perfect well,
I wanted to ask uh as songwriters do you remember the first song or lyric you,
wrote I don't know how old you were but want to hear some of that backstory how about you Cynthia yeah I was 16 and I,
wrote a song called maybe I think it was given to like a an South aferican girl group or something I mean I guess the,
first song that I wrote like on piano proper um I was probably 14 or 15 and I,
wrote this feminist Anthem called super man about how I,
didn't need Superman to come and save me yeah start him young so on the right,
track yeah gosh I mean when I think about mine it was completely different I,
was always like making up songs when I was really little and when I was about four or five years old I made up the,
song Albanian was my first language and so I sang it in Albanian and it was a song that ID made for my mom and I'd,
walk around the house and I'd be like when I grow up can I borrow your shoes and when I grow up can I wear your dress and when I grow up like can I be just,
like you and it actually just like stuck around it's kind of the one thing that like at home we just always remind,
ourselves up it was I love that horrible I love that how about you John oh well I,
was doing a lot of music instrumentally for many years and I started writing,
lyrics for a Shakespeare play that wanted songs in the play I probably,
about uh 21 and I started writing it I was like man characters and,
worlds and the expression of all these interconnected,
relationships and how I can make all these sounds come together that was the end of,
it I love that stuff yeah um I'm trying to think I think that,
like what comes to mind is probably when I was like eight or something and it was,
like it was like I'm going down down down into the black hole sweeping up,
your soul and I was like [Music] today I was just like I was like it's,
tight were you going through something at the time as a 8-year-old listen I was writing stories man I feel like the,
first song that I wrote was probably when I was like uh 11 is or no now that,
I think about it I think I was okay I was six and it was me and my friend we were playing the ukulele and it was a song about ukulele I don't know whatever,
you guys have good stories yeah I don't really have a good story I started writing like when I was,
six as well just B yeah really really bad um but the first thing I ever like,
got was this theme song for a Disney Channel show when I was like 17 a show,
called Austin and Alley love that song that was yeah my,
first like whatever the rest was history my gosh I wanted to ask too uh,
what's the first album you remember buying or downloading I think for some of us for me it was cassettes and CDs CU,
I'm older for some of you I imagine it's iTunes or Spotify but do you remember what was that first album that you,
bought Never Say Never Brandy I was obsessed obsessed with it obsessed and I would,
play it over and I remember I wrote her a letter I was like 12 or something when,
I wrote her letter because I just was obsessed with her voice I never heard anyone like that and I something about,
the sounds that she was making connected me with me really really deeply and I I,
think I bought more than one of those wow was this cassette or CD CD Wow and,
it's crazy now so many years later burner boys just samp sitting on top of the world full circle wow yeah don't,
think I'm not playing that over and over again I am it's like a nice little throwback to something that was a really sweet memory for me yeah what was do you,
remember what was in the letter I think I just wrote that she was my favorite singer and I think I must have thanked,
her for writing the album or something I don't know I just really connected with it um and something about the way she,
used Harmony in her songs was like new to me so it felt like oh I I like that I,
like what she's doing with her voice I want to learn to do that with my voice so yeah yeah it was really special yeah,
how about you Liv I remember getting my first phone was probably like 12 or 13,
and the first thing I did was download Lord Pure Heroin I love that record so much and I remember listening to it as I,
first started writing songs and just being blown away by um by her lyrics,
that are just about you know being a teenager living in the suburbs and I just remember never hearing my life be,
put um into a song like that where you know it just made being young and doing these seemingly unimportant things feel,
so sacred and beautiful and uh yeah that album is one of my favorites and um she still inspir me a lot to this day I you,
know when Royals came out the radio did not have that sound on it and I think she definitely opened doors to like not,
follow Trends and set her own Trends completely yeah I remember hearing that,
song in the radio for the first time was like one of those Pinch Me moments where you always remember like snapshot memory like oh my God what is this like changes,
the trajectory of your life um but yeah that's my first one now while you guys were speaking I was thinking it was,
either between Alicia Key's songs and am minina which I just absolutely love that,
record but it also wo Nelly by n fard was also a really big one for me and I,
feel I I wouldn't be able to know really which one came first but they were like I don't know it was something about,
Alicia's voice and kind of just like the pain and the love and the feeling and,
everything that she carried with it was so I don't know felt really meaningful I felt like I was going through a breakup,
having never had a boyfriend um and then Nelly Fado as well,
like I loved how she mixed her like Spanish Roots as as well with all the music that she made I felt really I love,
that there's something really cool about the combination of those two singers cuz they both have that sort of the ability,
to express pain in their voices so like where Nelly Fado's voice sits is like,
they have a ra like yeah there like I love that you found it both of them it's like interesting really cool yeah and,
they both came out the same year I remember that year they were both nominated for best new artists at the Grammys and also IND so it was like,
these three super unique different voices they're such strong female artists I think they really had their,
own identity and they knew exactly what they were talking about and they were just so open with their experiences and,
that's why I think people connected so and all around like 21 years old so it's,
amazing John what about you do you remember the first well CD or cassette you bought I bought CDs at Blockbuster,
video from the uh the U CD B I I I was playing gigs from a young age so I had,
some money I remember I first bought four records can't remember what the fourth record was but the the it was a,
cracked copy of Michael Jackson's dangerous and Erica Badu's Mama's,
gun I love and the uh oh my gosh that record so good it's like what you,
reminded me of with with Nelly and even just the the sound of her voice for sure,
but the artistic purpose MH every greats like all y'all have such clear just,
acutely aware profound artistic purposes every great artist has a great artistic,
purpose I'm still trying to figure mine out but I remember when I heard those records that's what I heard every one of,
oh yeah borc uh vespertine that was the fourth one and,
uh Voodoo D'Angelo those four records I remember that and I was like man it's super Super,
Con evicted everything about it is very much coming from the most pure channel,
that that space up there that we all try to dip into I like that a lot that album,
is crazy so and that when I was checking the lineing notes oh lineing notes oh I,
remember lineing notes yeah so you read the thing oh my gosh D'Angelo wrote this incredible just a uh a mission statement,
in there and then I looked at I was like like oh wow there's a lot of similarities Mama's gun and voodo were,
recording the year 2000 in Electric Lady Studios and a lot of crossover in terms of the Personnel then I was like that's,
why I got to get to New York yeah I got to get to New York City but uh yeah that,
Rec Spanish joint Spanish joint Spanish yeah you recorded some of your album yeah there I made lots of my new album,
at Electric Lady it's my favorite place ever such good history and was it your first time recording there yeah uhhuh it,
was so much fun I was used to like roll my eyes at people when they were like I love to go to New York it's like so,
inspiring I'm like sure like whatever how inspiring can it be but getting there yeah The Vibes are just incredible,
it's very hallowed Halls that studio you know so much to pull from oh my goodness you in the right place oh that's the,
best the best how about you Billy well I had a,
little blue MP3 player that was like this big and I remember I had hit Clips,
yeah girl I had I kissed a girl in there let's go and I was,
like noting noting how I feel about this but I also the first song I remember,
like trying to go buy and then download was sale by awal Nation but I didn't,
know who it was by I didn't know what song it even was and I looked up on iTunes like sale and I just bought the,
first one that I saw and it was like not the song and so I had only one song for,
a long time and it was saale by some guy some other song I don't could tell you what it was but Phineas my brother was,
really mad that he I did that but I was I Sal's sick that song is tight but I,
think um like the albums that I first remember like downloading and listening,
to like front to back were like Green Day I think like American Idiot yeah,
American Idiot was my it was a big one for me and my family yeah it's funny,
that what you mentioned about sale that was such a sleeper hit I love when you a song is released and like two years,
later it climbs and it's also been licensed literally TV shows car,
commercials like the amount of money he's made from that song is pretty magical you know and also I love the,
idea of like not thinking of that when creating the song and it just having its own life and that's that song like I,
don't care what anyone says like that song is like blew my mind that song was,
like the coolest I'd ever heard in my life it change it it like really I don't know it really inspired me in in,
in terms of just like different sounding stuff I don't know I also liked The,
Walking Dead and there's a character called who's the guy do you guys watch that you know when in the first season,
the guy that gets locked on the Roof oh yeah I always pict I always pictured him,
screaming S I thought he was singing sale in the song I was like picturing him screaming,
it yeah kids dude imagination is just good yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's also,
the other cool thing is like a wall nation has one of the biggest hits but I'm forgetting the the lead singer's,
name he can walk outside and just have an eny and just like that's like the,
perfect life almost yeah pretty ideal mailbox,
money oh yeah hell,
Julia I mean the first album I ever like was given for like Christmas was,
train um I know yeah with like Meet Virginia on it I just loved that song,
when I was a kid um and then obviously as I got older and angsty jag little pill was like my holy,
um I just loved her lyricism and just how Unapologetic she was and um and she,
was also hot a um yeah did you see her in Dogma do,
you there's a film called dog this is me being a GE ailm called dogma and she is,
spectacular she doesn't say a word doesn't say anything doesn't say anything I think 13 I was homeschooled,
yeah a couple homeschooled here right yeah ra your hand if you were school so I think like when you you're,
kind of like isolated and you're like kind of angsty she was the one like she,
was my president you obviously all have amazing film songs that have been out this year and writing them and putting,
them together I want to definitely talk to you all about them you the 100th anniversary of Disney did a lot of music,
for them what was that like and also did you do background B was on Let It Go from Frozen I did yeah wow hold on like,
I thought I read that somewhere and I was like wait what I did okay first tell us about that cuz you were already in,
the Disney family yes basically I was I think I was 19 at the time and I was,
doing demos around the city to sort of meet people and pay my rent and I got a,
call from uh someone that was working on the the Demi version of right the song,
and they're like hey we need some backgrounds done for this song it's for a Disney film I like yeah sure like no,
problem and um funny enough 10 years later cut two the song that I did,
backgrounds for the movie was directed by the same people that directed the film that I wrote all the songs for so,
it's just like a very beautiful serendipitous thing that that happened that unexpectedly like when you getting,
the call from Disney to cuz how many songs did you write for this film I did,
uh seven I believe for this we know Disney songs are huge no,
pressure yeah and uh dis wish tell us about the inspiration and putting that,
together I was told that the protagonist in this film was sort of a young,
activist basically there was a lot of corruption in her town and she basically,
wanted to fight for things that she found or um just sort of injust and I was like,
I can do that I kind of know what that is and yeah that was this wish and it's,
really beautiful it was the first song I wrote for the film and it just sort of stood the test of time throughout the,
threee process of making the movie three years and what like after writing that did that kind of like open the,
floodgates for you to be able to finish the other songs yeah it was very interesting I've never,
done songs for a film before I've only ever really written songs with artists,
or for myself so this was very new and the process was new cuz I'd be like Oh,
I'm done and then they call me two days later and be like oh we have a new song and we need it done in like three weeks,
I'm like okay but overall it was a really,
beautiful process and love it and so cool I know you Cynthia's new film drift,
she not only Stars it she's produced it and written music for it,
so hand clap there so I wonder in addition to the inspiration behind the,
song what was it also like wearing so many hats I mean as a producer I'm sure you were so hands on yeah with this it,
was nuts cuz it was you know a little I always Call It The Little Engine That C because it was made for nothing,
basically a little Indie movie that we made on location in Greece and we didn't have much time to do it in so I'm on set,
but thinking about the schedule and making sure that we can get shots done when we need to get shots done but also,
being able to like hey we need to finish off this scene are we going to have enough time for that but trying to be in,
scenes that are really tough really hard but the song I think was the easiest,
part for me to be honest cuz it sort of was inspired when I was on a run one,
morning and I listened to this song by an artist called Laura Mula called far,
mother and for some reason it uh connected with where I was at that time,
what I was feeling what I was experiencing and what this movie was about and so I knew automatically that I,
wanted to work with Laura because I I thought she understood the language of where I where I was and what I was doing,
so I I text her I didn't tell anyone else first that is what I wanted to do which is not what you're supposed to do,
um I text her and I was like would you be into working with me on on a on a song for this she said yes then I told,
them this is who I want to write this with and and that's what's going to happen I don't think I gave yeah I don't,
think I gave him a choice and then we sat in a studio after she'd watched the movie and,
she sent me this message she was like it feels like there's like water and movement and transition and she was,
really moved by it and so I felt like she understood and we sat we wrote this song and it didn't take us very long to,
write it I think we wrote in like a couple days and then she did lots of production on it and the first thing I,
she's there's these two chords that she plays I think on the on like the organ it just,
[Music] goes and I was like oh I'm there so as,
we started playing with our vocals and trying to figure out what it wanted to be it just sort of made itself really,
yeah it was it's I really I'm really proud of it cuz it felt like it was the language of the piece that we were we,
had made yeah awesome beautiful thank you I know you Olivia Hunger Games,
everyone is so excited for this to come out for you what was the inspiration in in creating this song it was so much fun,
I mean um most of my songs are very like diaristic in nature and kind of about my,
life and it was such a fun challenge to get to watch this movie Through The Eyes of this character and then go and you,
know try to capture her experience through um you know my words and my voice I find that there's so much,
inspiration in in restricting yourself sometimes I don't know if you guys ever have this but it's like you know when,
you have every color in the palette and and any canvas you want it's just so overwhelming that sometimes I think,
limiting yourself actually makes you just think outside the box and reinvent um and so I think that's one of,
the joys about um you know writing a song for a movie is there's this um you,
know beautiful storyline that you kind of get to color in with with um your own words so um yeah had a lot of fun and uh,
it was a very welcome challenge so I'm really happy to do it and John you have,
a documentary that your song is friend so let us know a little bit about the documentary and also writing music for,
this it started out as one thing and then it changed life came into the,
picture you know I started to write a symphony that was premiered at Carnegie,
Hall and I wanted to document the process of the last year,
of going and answering the question of what would a symphony be if it was,
invented by someone like me in the 21st century who would be on stage what would,
they play what would that experience be like I wrote this piece called American,
Symphony so that's the title of the documentary but you know we started to film in about a month into filment there,
was a lot of changes in my life personally as well as in my career you,
know there was the week of being notified of being nominated for 11 Grammys was the week that you know super,
cash I mean it was literally happening people knew about that they didn't know,
you know my wife she got diagnosed with leukemia so we didn't know if she was going to make it I remember I got a call,
from President Biden and we were in the chemotherapy Ward and he was congratulating me about the nominations,
while we were getting news about what her treatment would be so then we decided to keep filming so it became the,
Symphony of life you know like how life has the duality of the highs and lows,
sometimes all at once sometimes extreme highs and lows all at once so the music in the film is largely the symphony but,
there was a moment where Matt and I the director we talked,
about what song would be appropriate as a final statement it's you're very,
moving to think about about so she's doing great now I was going to ask thank God just to preface but when she was in,
the hospital you know it was about two two months where we didn't know if she was going to make it and in the hospital,
there all these sounds you know it's like beeps and all of these people coming in and out of the room and all,
the the range of things that disturb your rest and I believe rest is important for the spirit to heal and all,
these things that I wanted to help her with so I started writing her these lullab she's a writer she would actually,
listen to your music your music while she painted cuz she started painting,
just because her vision was blurred from the medication so she couldn't write anymore so her creative Outlet was to,
paint while I would write these lullab none of them were meant to come out but the song came from one of these lullab,
that I wrote over that course of 30 or 40 days of being in and out of the hospital so that's what the song The the,
ethos of the song is from that period which I thought was a beautiful way to kind of tie a bow on this this work that,
we didn't know what we were making when we were doing it and it was hard we had to reassess the decision every single,
month it's like 14 hours a day this filmmaker Matthew Hinman is known for,
being in war zones and embedded in drug cartels and he doesn't make films like,
this and it was such a part of our life we'd be in bed he'd be there I'm,
literally one day I open the door and I'm in the shower I'm like why are you filming and then he was like I'm only,
shooting from the waist up and I was like do I really want to do this but you,
know we did it and I think it'll help some people and that's what I'm about so,
it's there I hope it moves some people and thank y'all for what y'all do cuz I was very aware of the profundity of what,
we do in her healing process with music and creativity creativity as an act of,
survival and I believe in that so strongly I believed in it before but now,
I'm just like let's go let's make more beautiful things I love that you know as,
creators what is it like when you do hear that your music has really help,
someone in a hard time uh really just helping them persevere when when it's so,
hard to to think positively it's hard to take in I find myself like it's overwhel,
yeah I don't really know how to like believe it because I know what it's like,
to be in that position and it's so real and to think that you're helping,
somebody who's in that is really um it's hard to believe and it's really astounding and special and almost you,
feel like undeserving like I didn't deserve to help you through that but it's so special and powerful,
and that's a great way of put you know like I feel that way a lot people say some stuff and I'm,
like you know yeah yeah but it's so be a part of someone's like so magical experience it's very surreal it makes,
you focus in on the thing that you're actually doing so there's lots of noise around the actual art of making,
something making music making film making TV whatever it is but when a person has taken the time to listen to,
be there where meet you where you're at meet you where you were when you made the thing and take that with them in,
their daily life and use it as a tool to help them get through whatever they're getting through,
you're a part of their lives you have made something that that sticks with,
them that they get to carry with them and that is possibly one of the most incredible honors you can have yeah,
really so that anything else is just not important that is the important thing,
making things that that people can hang on to when there's nothing else to hang on to I think to refocus whenever it,
feels like everything else is out of focus on that I think that's really really special you're so,
poetic I'm hanging on every word you can just talk yes,
yes that means a lot cuz you know for me it's like if I'm honest I don't know,
that you could have told me when I was 15 16 that I I would be there I would be here that I could make music and have,
people listen to it it was like a pine guy dream you know I feel the same so when people I feel completely the same,
like I thought it was like as unrealistic as cartoon on TV like I would I would watch artists and I'd be,
like oh my God imagine doing something like that but never ever thinking that that was even a possibility that same,
doing this sitting here like making music writing songs putting them out connecting with people going on tour,
like connecting one toone with people in a room it's just it's such a profound experience that it seems so far from,
reach but it's real and it's so cool that it's real because when there's uh you know you have like younger fans or,
people looking up to you listeners like they they can also just see that and be like oh that could actually be me too,
and it's real it's actually it's real and it's possible and it's it's so cool to especially as like a songwriter too,
like growing up with like Shelley pikin and Linda Perry and Lindy Ro like all of,
the songwriters that wrote for like all of your favorite pop artists you're like how do you do that like how do you even,
get there you know and then to be able to like know them write with them be,
here is like such a beautiful thing too yeah do you guys think about that when you're writing songs I find it,
incredibly difficult to think about it when I'm like actually in the process of it I think it doesn't hit me the impact of it until like months later like on,
tour or something I think about this a lot John in your um in your Grammy speech a few years ago you said you were,
like I show up every day I make music every day CU it's a spiritual practice for me I think about that all the time,
and that's totally what it is if I don't like write every day or create something I I don't feel like myself I don't feel,
fulf it doesn't matter if I like put it out you know what I mean it's it's just like it's something that you need to do,
just like breathing or eating or you know that's what it feels like feel more anxious when I completely I feel so,
anxious it's like an ex that happens with I mean like I feel like for me like,
I think just as creatives in general like we have a lot of things that go on in our minds all the time and so writing,
is sort of like the Deep exhale so just like letting it out and then you have this sort of tangible thing that you can,
take with you everywhere you're like okay it's sort of not in my body it's here now this how I feel right here are,
you all writing every day normally or is it when you're like I'm going to go create a song I try it's so hard but I,
try if I'm not writing I'm writing something not writing necessarily always songs but I write songs almost every day,
yeah I love it though it's like I just love it so much well I know we have these Barbie songs that have been just,
like taken over the entire world first of all the whole album is fire so many,
amazing different songs on there I want to ask you do a a dance tonight obviously is killing it what was it like,
for you putting that song together I mean from the very beginning the most fun experience it was something that I,
hadn't done before it was a completely new experience I don't know it basically the way it way it came to be was Mark,
Ronson who's a friend of mine dm'd me on Instagram which that's amazing which is weird because also we're like friends so,
we text but he chose that as a form of a medium yeah exactly um and so he,
basically hit me up and he was like I'm working on this film with Greta Gerwig and it's for Barbie and it's possibly,
the funniest script I've read and I really want you to write the song for the big dance scene in the film and I,
"was like like this is an absolute no-brainer like 1,000% yes like such a big fan of Greta's work and I love Mark",
and it was just it just so such an easy yes I was however on tour at the time so,
I was like okay when does this song need to be due yeah how much time do we have and when can we get in the studio and I,
basically I just flew to New York we went in the studio and we just had so much time like talking to Greta,
understanding the premise of the film and what I loved is what you were saying about the dualities of life and I think,
that really comes across in the Barbie film especially for the people who haven't seen it maybe it's like the,
importance of going and understanding like the deeper meaning of the film is so much about you know stereotypical,
Barbie having an existential crisis and finding out what it's like to be or to experience essentially like The Human,
Condition and the way that we are as people and the emotions that we feel and constantly striving for Perfection but,
not quite reaching it or trying you know always trying to I don't know we're we're constantly looking or striving for,
something deeper in a way and I think when making dance a night and Greta saying how inspired by disco she was I,
just thought about disco and the community it brings and you know the way it brings people together you know a,
genre of music that was such a release when things weren't going well in the world or whatever was happening it was,
so freeing to be able to go and and release everything that was outside and just enjoy that and so dance and night,
was created specific specifically for Barbie's Best Day Ever which then results in her thinking about,
death so it's really about those dualities of life and being able to merge the two together and that's what I,
love the most like I I love dance crying that's really like that's my that's my,
genre you know I I it's there's nothing that makes me feel more of a releas and,
I think there's important to have some like optimism through the I don't know,
through the pain there's so much happening so it's good to to have music and dance to to to release and disc when,
I listened to it I was like this I was immediately thrown into the 70s and I love what you're saying about the,
background that it was on cuz that music that disco was the place that all of the,
The Misfits went to it's where all of the people that didn't feel like they belonged went to that's where they,
Studio 54 is where everyone went ude to to convene if you didn't feel like you were normal if you didn't feel like you,
fit in and you wanted to fit somewhere and you wanted to connect with someone that's where they went and they listened,
to that and so when I when I was listening to it I was like that's what it feels like it's it's got that energy,
in it it was really cool oh thank you and I I love a dance song with good lyrics I feel like sometimes because the,
melody or the beat can be so good sometimes you listen to the lyrics and you're like what that don't even rhy you,
know and so I love that like with a good dance song with good lyrics the lyrics are almost hidden and you catch them,
later it's almost like rewatching a TV show or a film and noticing something else but that's what I love about that,
my gosh we we took so much time to like initially we wrote the song and then we,
went back two weeks later and we kind of watched the scene with the song in it,
and I was like wait a second this I need to do some changes I need to do some lyric changes and we basically tell,
little moments to the moves that were happening in the film so you can marry the moments together um so that was,
really fun it was like a really interesting jigsa puzzle and something yeah it was it was really special but I,
just this whole process with the song and even with the new record I never,
wanted to like let go of a good idea before it used to be like if I didn't get the whole song that day then it,
probably wasn't worth fighting for I don't know but now I'm like if if there's one part that I love I'll just,
keep digging keep digging I mean Julia knows like I feel like I have dragged,
her into my my madness but but I love your process I actually love that about,
you because there are so many artists that will like give up on a song after one day if it's not like perfect and,
you're the first one to be like this part is exceptional I want to make sure this other part is exceptional and I'm,
like yeah like it should be got to keep digging that's Yeah dance and night did a lot digging and I love that y all,
killed that I was rivy to see I walked into the studio with Mark and I saw all,
of y'all's notes hanging on the wall oh my God he showed me the scene it was,
just like the amount of excavation that y'all did I that was very impressive I I,
really believe in that too I love that you said that because sometimes you find something that's so great and it's,
speaking but it just hasn't met the rest of its tribe yet right so you there's no,
reason to put it away for good that's right but the way the intricacy of that scene he broke it down for me a little,
bit I hope you all right with that of course but so I was like wow the whole,
movie is just the whole Barb movie is is a lot it's it's very deep yeah,
existential that's woo it's very Whitman esque it's got a whole bunch of stuff in,
it that's underneath the surface that's what I I love about a dance song right,
with a great lyric your lyrics you always have great Melodies and you always make sure the lyrics reach the,
level of The Melodies thank you cuz dance music my gosh people can get lazy,
it can be like ring on the be let me that y' killing that I like I love that,
oh thank you very much I find myself like throughout most of my days this so,
it's just like in my head a lot I don't know why it's catchy girl it's really,
good but Barbie song girl so what was,
take over John yes do it do it please go ahead I want to know like what,
what's happening I don't know why why that that,
progression of dude I just but it's just it immediately,
my heart goes immediately thank you where were,
you that's the first thing that I wrote was that like exact,
Melody um it was okay so it was a a rainy day in,
January and it was the day after we'd seen it and I was just like it was dark for me in my life and my brother and I,
were working and we were trying to make stuff for this album like my album we're working on and it was just like a day of,
of nothing it was just like idea after idea after idea of just like no ideas,
like nothing was happening it was like the least creative we came up with so many different things and it was an,
instance where we were like yeah we're scratching these like this isn't even worth our time and it must have been I,
think we were doing that for probably like six hours and it was about I want to say like 800 pm and I was like all,
right well I'm out of here like this is I'm gonna go home we're done for the day we tried we're gonna you know call it,
quits and then he was like just for shits and giggles what if we tried to write that,
song MH and I was like you think after the day of like garbage we've just made,
we're going to make a a perfect song for for something that is so like that needs,
something really good I was like I don't even have that in me first of all I didn't know I would have it in me at all when it was brought up to me I was like,
I mean thank you for asking but I don't know if I can give you what you're going to need like I want you to have,
something astounding and hopefully I can get close to that but I don't know and,
finus literally sat at the piano and immediately started playing,
the and um we've been using a handheld mic in the room that just plays like,
through the speakers instead of like headphones and sitting at the I never like use a booth or anything so I was,
yeah dude yes and so I was sitting um on the little couch with the handheld and,
he was playing those chords and it was just,
like and then then um you know we were,
talking a lot about the like falling Elegance or the the floating like Elegance of of her and her ability to,
you know be so smooth and beautiful and perfect all the time and then you know the ju position of her suddenly falling,
and like can't do everything perfectly and so immediately it was that I used to float now I just fall down and we,
immediately wrote that and then I used to know but I'm not sure now and I immediately was like what I was made for,
and then we were both like what was I like asking the question after that and then we had that we did that in probably,
like five minutes it was crazy it was like the it was God it was God I don't,
know it was like some other yeah it was just the most perfect example to me of,
like true true true inspiration and connection and it was living in me that,
whole day but it wasn't coming out of me and yeah as soon as we hit the what was I made for line we were both like oh,
okay and it's weird cuz we didn't you know again we didn't go into it knowing at all what we were going to make um or,
if we were going to make anything and it was just so clear that we needed,
to and like you were saying Olivia like I love writing for like film it's like,
one of my favorite things to do not even just film but in like for something because the assignment I really love an,
assignment I love a prompt and for me you know I'm listening to you especially,
and everybody talking about songwriting and you're just so good at it and you just do it and it's easy and it's fast,
okay don't laugh and like for me I find songwriting very difficult and I find um,
honesty in songwriting very hard and out of my reach and there's something so,
special to me about writing about not my,
life and so when we're writing it you know I'm not thinking about my life I,
was like this isn't about me all this is just totally about another girl another,
character it has nothing to do with my life and I swear on my like I swear to,
God I never thought about myself one time I was thinking about a character and my brother was thinking about a,
character and then we wrote basically the entire song that night aside from the ending verse and then the next day,
or two later I played it for a friend and we were sitting in the car and I was,
like I was like what who who,
this I was like this is singing about me and it was,
scary it was like I'm like shaky like it was it was scary I felt like it was like,
if you woke up and like someone had taken a photo of you sleeping like where how are you how did you do that and um I,
don't know it was it was crazy and I I felt also I'm talking a lot but also I was my,
brother and I both were in a period of like complete I don't even think,
writer's block is necessarily real I just think sometimes we are not able to,
pull it out of us um but it was that it was a period of time when I just had,
nothing I had nothing to say I didn't know how to say what I thought I could say and we really hadn't written,
anything in a minute and I felt really worried and I was like damn I honestly was concerned that it was,
over for me yeah I gotta be honest with you I really was like cuz where were you in the middle of this new album like had,
you been trying for a while we' had been trying and it wasn't really doing what,
it usually would do like I in in me and I was honestly like damn like maybe I,
hit my Peak and I'm don't know how to write anymore like I don't know how to do this and crazy thank God for that was,
do brain and buy sing try something El it was also your brother feeling this way too yeah no it was very I I mean I,
thank God for Greta man I she saved me really honestly like getting that request it was like a FaceTime it was a,
FaceTime and it it brought us both out of it and it put us in a just like,
immediately we were inspired and wrote so much more after that and being that,
honest without mean to was a lot and um especially when it came out I was,
like it was like somebody like reading your you know diary or something did it unlock something in you where like oh I,
actually can be like extremely vulnerable well and it be like received,
yes and no but yes because the way that it rece was received was so shocking to,
me I guess I forget that everybody feels the same in so many ways and that,
everything we feel somebody knows you know and like not be the same thing but,
it's the same emotion it's the same emotion exactly and I was really really moved by that and especially the way,
that it brought women together was like something that I feel,
so just proud of and I feel so I don't know like when it came out,
and and and it was such a a girl a girl thing I was like I don't know it feel,
really cool speaking of women how amazing is this table I'm sorry like so like be doing,
this at a time where there really is like so much camaraderie with women is so excuse me,
John but like just like being at a table with people who are genuinely happy for,
each other is so exciting and it's very true like it really is true like I love,
you all like I want you all to win like it's so sick sorry I mean I felt that way on when,
trying to book this and get people and as I was like seeing who had songs I was like oh my God we could have this,
amazing young female songwriters for for young women to see see all this,
representation I think is so key and so we got it and John and me,
so we have y back I saw that when I got the invitation I was like I want to come,
learn from all of you this is the thing that's it I love what you said about the,
diary and about bringing women together especially you've been a voice for your generation so so profoundly but I think,
that's people want to read your diary but they also want to read their diary,
yes yes they want to read and it turns out it's like maybe the same the same,
that's like oh snap do you are connected have like a lyric that you feel like is so personal that you're like they're not,
g to like should I change it they're not going to understand it and then they get it in a way they internal they see you,
what I was going to say was when you were talking um about almost kind of manifesting your own life into the song,
does anybody else feel that when you write you're almost manifesting things that are about to happen completely like,
when you're about to write something and you're like should I be putting this in a song cuz I'm be saying this a lot is,
this a self-fulfilling prophecy exactly I feel that like so much I feel like I I look back at songs that I relate to now,
more than I ever did wrot them I don't and some songs Take on completely new,
meanings I think it's evidence that songs come from the Divine that sometimes they know things that we don't,
know so true we call it sometimes the M like,
we h vessel I got something for you today I,
love what you said really about loving writing for movies and for me I mean I,
think I've only been doing it for maybe two three years and it's a couple songs here and there and and I really enjoy it,
because usually I'm in the thing and having to write about the thing that I was in and so there's this weird sort of,
like double view that I have to see through and then I have to filter,
what I've experienced what is in the thing into this,
singular moment for people to listen to but it feels like I'm exposing,
everything I've already been through on the project I've been through so it feels like my heart is like beating on,
the outside of my chest you're like naked yeah but I I love that I love that,
the task is that and so there is no choice but to to do that and the and the,
only way to do it so that people connect is to be as naked and vulnerable as you possibly can I know I think you don't,
give yourself enough credit for being as vulnerable as you are and just because your process is different to someone else's it doesn't mean that it's not a,
process still you understand if it takes you a year to get to the album that you,
want to get to it takes you a year to get to the album it doesn't mean it's over it just means that you're taking time it's like building a battery up,
again you know that's just how it is therapist,
just so wise I just I also love in terms of writing for film yeah I love a challenge,
love a challenge cuz you don't know what you're going to find and I love a like a kind of get like I don't know if it's,
going to like I love a a not guarantee you know I don't know what's I don't,
know I think for me I've realized that like my whole life is an act of service,
I feel the most like of purpose when I can serve something or somebody so,
whether that's like an arti artist or a project like I like being there for like,
the making of and being a part of something and knowing that like I got to like be there for it like that's such a,
beautiful thing I mean you have been a part of so many songs they have a list of like some of the artists let's let's,
just do a look Justin be Selena Gomez Bry Spears Lady Gaga Ed Sharon John,
Legend Shawn Mendes Kelly CL Mar 5 pink Casey mus Graves,
Shira Irv Dy lado HR Marin Morris Gwenn Stefani Nick Jonas gon Shay One Republic,
Kelsey ballerini Lincoln Park Ben plat 5 Seconds of Summer Fifth Harmony Hy,
steinfield Sabrina Carpenter okay Little Mix Zed R or the frey and also do aifa,
working together all all and not even everyone so ni my OBS like why does that,
why is it hard for you to listen I don't know I like I think I'm just so used to being like in the,
background that like when like when someone like wants to therapist I don't,
know it it really like freaks me out I said this to another artist I said this,
or not artist before but I love I love what I do I it's really important for you we believe you really important for,
you to be able to sit in the power of being able to make other people's dreams come true as well that's a really,
special thing I know I know but it's a really but it's a really special and singular talent that you have and you do,
yourself and the work you've done a disservice to not just sit in it that's your work I'm horrible with like it's,
your anything I'm like I want to be like I just want to be like a turtle but you deserve it all if you didn't work for it,
it wouldn't come to you you deserve it it's not you didn't do the work you did all of the you feel bad for being,
talented oh my God no I just I don't know I just I I like I like I said I,
like it's such an act of service I'm not like good with people I like I just want to be there for people but you are,
you're good because with people you are but I think we I think we assume we get off no like I think it's so important,
because I think we think that an active service doesn't include it it doesn't include acknowledging the work that,
we've done and that that is also an act of service because in if another young lady is watching you take ownership of,
the stuff that you've done you're telling her that it's okay to take ownership of the stuff that she's done,
right that is speak up on my throat you know I know like and it's important I,
think we don't like I think we don't like take that into account it is important for other people to see us cuz,
women we don't do it enough to say yeah I I did do that and I'm really proud of that because another young lady is going,
to look at you and go well if she's okay with doing it if I'm okay with then I'm okay to say I did that I'm really proud,
of it that is an act of service also it isn't arrogance to say I'm really proud of the work I've done and you've done it,
and you have all thanks and then some thanks yeah you're good you're very,
good okay who else [Laughter] Olivia Hunger,
Games so you deserve it all you're the greatest so we're we're Clos to uh,

fine it's fine say fine I don't know about you but I love,
seeing so many talented women and a man come together in a beautiful harmonious,
conversation until next time I'm Evon orgy and this is offs script with The Hollywood,
if i could place my paintings somewhere,
between oasis and juan de basinbach i,
would be a happy,
Person growing up,
in this paradox of,
a really close-knit community in east,
germany mostly musicians and artists but,
then,
afterwards you realized they were all,
spies all spotting each other and spying,
on my mom or my parents,
nearly everyone i we were all of our,
friends back then or my parents friends,
were informants from stasi so there is,
an insane amount of in retrospect the,
naivety of growing up in this in this,
collective,
idea almost utopian idea of this,
close-knit collective,
and then immediately later,
you know 91,
you find out it was all it was a,
complete betrayal of everything you,
thought you know what my parents thought,
of course as a kid you don't you think,
it's fantastic i had a great childhood,
and uh just in retrospect you realize,
how limited everything was but there was,
extra an extreme amount of poetry in,
this limitation these limitations and i,
still,
feel like it's part of my work you know,
that that kind of like the poetry the,
poetry of limitations so,
all these things i think the betrayal,
the utopian aspects of communism,
the limitations all this informs your,
work,
and i think the biggest step,
then was to take all this and take it to,
another continent which was america,
[Music],
of course the elements of german,
romanticism for you know german,
philosophy,
you know the heavy topics they were,
already there,
but i was too close to it and and then i,
was really always drawn to american,
popular culture you know mostly music,
films all that all we did in in art,
school was like,
you know it was,
american,
culture,
so i needed to go there really to kind,
of like,
understand myself,
through going away so i felt like it's a,
good place to,
to tell my story you know you know in a,
city where,
the world's,
story gets narrated you know,
manufactured and narrowed it,
in an ideal world i'm a passenger,
within my own work,
and and that means that the best thing,
is to be,
almost next to my work not in my work,
where i feel like,
i'm guiding it and,
at times i might have the,
Ability to create the environment for the work,
To so it can create itself and,
on a good day,
i'm a radio where the antennas are,
spread wide open,
and it flows through me,
and then it and then it just happens,
it's a very,
primal exchange of energies me and the,
canvas like it's it's,
centuries old,
so you have the abstract me the,
unconsciousness and then like all the,
other things that are super necessary to,
me i project them on it and then,
eventually paint over it that's why you,
see in these,
in my paintings you see the background,
always like i'm always behind the image,
that's my little voice,
in 2003 i got really sick from drugs and and,
drinking,
uh almost died,
and of course immediately stopped had to,
stop and since then i'm sober,
that's when i started making the work,
more performative work was already done,
till i then had,
all the experience all the,
all the stories or everything i needed,
to do the work i already lived through,
all the pain all the fun and everything,
so i felt like i could now,
report back in a way it's like i'm ready,
to write that book i remember i had this,
this empty canvas that was sitting in,
another studio it was a small apartment,
in cologne,
and it was an empty thing and and and,
came from the hospital painted painted,
it black,
and put a a door,
knob and a door,
painted a little,
rainbow at the bottom of the door and i,
and i wrote down the the,
the words,
if you leave me can i come too,
i don't know how and and,
but it became i could do i painted the,
door into another world in a way that,
painting really like opened everything,
or closed everything and then it kind of,
kept on rolling a bit there's never a,
conscious moment where i'm sitting down,
and saying like let's do this this this,
it all leads up the way i work i have,
like all these elements cartoons,
everyday objects,
i see the the paintings as my movie and,
then they're like they come and act,
again and then,
disappear and then they come again so,
it's like in the end maybe i when i when,
i'm really old i look into,
my paintings and then i was like,
there's this recurring,
ensemble,
of actors,
polluting my paintings things that,
shouldn't be together,
are colliding within a painting,
and,
what it creates is this kind of like,
space,
lost it's of time,
of space of meaning,
basically a,
vacuum of of,
images,
um,
and then on to it the text comes and and,
maybe describes,
something of a feeling or an emotion or,
it gives it a direction of,
you know things i i gravitate to which,
is melancholia,
euphoria,
misunderstanding relationships,
disappointment,
humor,
idiocity,
all these things,
somehow,
is it's a grammar of all these things,
combined pollute or infect these these,
kind of landscapes that,
are about 200 years old,
and,
a landscape of course we learned that,
from the romantics it's a it's a,
it's also an inward psychology,
i think casper david friedrich we did,
extremely well,
in,
turning land landscape inwards,
by putting a figure in front of the,
viewer,
and in the same way i use these,
a few hundred years later i use these,
kind of fragments of of our collective,
imagery,
and and and placed them into these kind,
of,
psychedelic landscapes,
and uh,
i need a break,
comes in from the clouds there's a,
tennis court,
there's a tenant lost tennis ball in the,
dirt somewhere i think there's a,
fox,
and a squirrel from a cartoon i think a,
czech cartoon it's it's,
maybe a psychogram of whatever i,
felt at that time and of course when i,
when i need i need a break it's it's a,
tennis reference right,
it's in order to win,
normally you need a break,
but,
the idiocity of,
the ability the ambivalency of that is,
is also i love that kind of,
you know tennis has a lot of weird,
references like 40 love,
like 40 love or i did another one like,
love means zero because antennas love,
means zero,
this is like,
unbelievable no,
so you know it's these little,
it's something light,
but also heavy it's tennis you know it's,
like it means nothing love means nothing,
but it means everything,
i love these things,
every day,
i sit down,
and research and listen to music maybe a,
couple days an hour,
and i have a book i write everything,
down that,
misheard lyrics lyrics fragments of,
lyrics i i drive to work i i hear,
something i don't know we're going oh,
okay write it down i mix them up so i,
have like a,
all these books with full filled with,
lyrics and sentences and,
they're almost creative weird to read,
within me whenever i look at an image i,
can't help myself,
that something in my brain is is,
puking out that sentence,
and and and because i've done it for so,
long it's like it because it became so,
natural it's almost like to give,
everything a subtext,
i could walk down the street look at a,
tree,
see a,
a tree falling down and i'm like five,
leaf five leaves left for example and,
that's in the trade quote,
so,
there's this meandering kind of like,
um,
it's like a machine gun that keeps on,
firing these these sentences and then it,
takes like sometimes a month,
because i have 20 sentences boil it down,
to 10 boil it down to 5. so i have five,
sentences,
and then it i mean maybe that's maybe,
the only,
real work because i sit there and then,
and it's such it's so difficult to hit,
exact that,
that,
moment where it doesn't explain too much,
it doesn't explain too less it's not too,
funny but it's,
it can be funny,
it is so difficult and then you can only,
put yourself into the arms,
and trust your instinct but once it's,
done the the sentence finds its way by,
the way it's almost like it's ready for,
the world,
but then it's like the the kiss of,
goodbye when it says like it's ready to,
leave and i think if you use irony as a,
technique to combine with,
romanticism it works really well because,
it's that it's,
it becomes almost like a play,
but it doesn't make fun of it,
it's not saying like,
it it's not saying you it still,
says i love you and that's i think,
always,
the kind of like demarcation line to,
cynicism,
maybe humor is also a tool to be it's,
like a trojan horse you know to invite,
you,
to this to this idea of,
making it light and approachable and,
funny but i think good humor also and,
good satire has,
built in this is this very deep,
dark existentialism,
that's what gets the comedy gets tragic,
again,
and i think these are totally,
intertwined,
that in the joke there's a deep,
psychology of loss and,
everything in it but,
i i i believe i want to,
coming from popular music maybe even,
such i'm such a fan of it,
i want to draw you in,
the rainbows the sunsets,
these are all helpless,
tools to draw you in good art has that,
kind of,
it draws you in and then it then it,
you up and it builds you up again,
the sense of homelessness permeates my,
complete earthworm this aspect of the,
ambiguity of our existence to paint or,
to make these work is to feel at home to,
to go words,
to feel,
found to feel understood when you're in,
the presence of something great,
you feel understood and you feel like,
you're not alone and it's as easy as,
this,
And i,
always felt like,
i don't have that too much with with,
paintings,
anymore,
and,
that's where i see my purpose that's,
where i see,
i can i can,
contribute you know even if it's,
a 13 year old reaching out on instagram,
to me and saying like it saved his day,
it sounds very cheesy but,
that's that's all i care,
because then i've i i know,
eventually that's the bit i passed the,
baton,
i you know there was like the thing that,
moved me like i,
it was my duty to pass it on you know,
it's terribly kitsch and cheesy but,
it really comes down to that you have to,
ask yourself as an artist am i,
interested in,
articulating an,
intellectual idea that that is,
interesting to 10 people,
you're just totally fine if that's your,
thing,
but that never really interests me,
you know again i come from music so,
it of course it was always this kind of,
element that i was drawn to,
I don't really know how to do this sort of prep stuff,
without it being somewhat intensive,
because otherwise I just don't feel I have the confidence.,
I always imagine that I'm gonna get to set,
"and the director's gonna go,",
"""I don't even like this scene. Make it up.""",
And I've gotta be ready for that.,
"And if I'm not ready for that,",
I feel very insecure arriving on the set.,
[upbeat music],
"Patrick Bateman, American Psycho",
American Psycho.,
"New card, what do you think?",
"Whoa, very nice. Look at that.",
Picked them up from the printers yesterday.,
Good coloring.  That's bone.,
"Any scene we were doing every single day,",
I had the book by my side,
and I would read through it every single time,
because Brett had just had so many wonderful descriptions.,
And I think that was why Mary and I clicked,
"was because when I first went and auditioned for her,",
I just went to her apartment,
and it was just her with a little camera.,
"And I didn't approach it like she said,",
the other actors had where they were talking,
"about what's his childhood,",
what's the reason he's become this?,
"I was like, ah, none of that really matters.",
He's just like this alien.,
"And so as we were doing the scene,",
I started laughing and she started cracking up,
and we both realized,
we had the same very sick sense of humor.,
"And we were like, oh yeah, right, this will work between us.",
"She really put herself on the line, you know?",
And I so appreciate that,
because she had so many known actors,
who were stepping up and wanted to do it.,
"And she just said, ""no, I want Christian,""",
even though all the financiers were saying,
"""we're gonna give you no money.""",
And then actually kicked the two of us off.,
"You know, we went",
and we did a stage reading in New York for it.,
"William Defoe was there, Chloe Sevigny was there,",
and Brace and Ellis was there.,
And then we got the money. Yay!,
"But what our agents forgot to do,",
our agents at the time forgot to do,
was to include us in the package.,
"And so we raised the money and then they said,",
"""right, and the two of you bye-bye.""",
But I went a little bit psycho myself in that,
"and I just said, ""no, I'm still making the film.""",
"And even though other people were cast,",
"other directors were on board,",
I just kept on prepping and I would call Mary up,
"and she would say,",
"""Christian, they've given it to other people.""",
"And I was like, yeah yeah yeah, no, it doesn't matter.",
We're still gonna make it.,
"And she was like, oh, he is lost the plot.",
"And all my friends were saying that to me like,",
what are you doing?,
And I was turning down.,
"This wasn't like I was getting offered much, but you know,",
"couple of projects, not very good ones,",
I turned them down. And kept on going.,
"And lo and behold, look at that it did eventually come back.",
So that felt like a great victory.,
Don't doubt. You got instincts.,
"You know, always listen, always be aware of the style",
"that the director's looking for,",
but understand you always gonna bring,
something unique from anybody else.,
When there's still was the Wall Street trading floors,
"and everything, I went and visited, you know,",
"all different levels of people at Wall Street,",
"but the guys on the trading floor,",
"when I arrived there before making the film,",
"I got there and a bunch of 'em, they were going,",
"Patrick Bateman had patted me on the back and going,",
"oh yeah, we love him.",
"And I was like, yeah, ironically, right?",
"And they were like, what do you mean?",
So it was always worrying even back then.,
"But you know, clearly, look,",
it's a satire on capitalism in the 80s,
and as such is so bloody far fetched and ridiculous,
"that you know, to me, I can't help but think it's hilarious.",
? You know I love you but I just can't take this ?,
Do you like Phil Collins?,
"Been a big Genesis fan,",
"ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke.",
I'm not gonna ruin anyone's enjoyment,
and say that I'm not a huge fan,
and that they're not life changing songs.,
"Of course they are for everyone, right?",
Come on when you admit it.,
"For me, music's so much a part of",
actually building characters as well.,
"You know, like for Amsterdam,",
David and I were listening to and watching,
"a lot of jazz documentaries, et cetera.",
"And I use all sorts of different music to help me, you know,",
get into the mood when I'm working.,
'Cause emotion really comes through the ears.,
"You know, something that you notice",
"when you're in the edit room,",
"you really see how you can see the visual,",
"keep that the same, but change the music",
and it absolutely changes the way you feel about it.,
"So it's such a, you know, joy of life.",
"Get a goddamn job, Al.",
You got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you.,
I remember somebody threatening me on the street,
'cause some people did object to the film getting made,
and all that.,
And I remember people saying that they were gonna do me harm,
"and stuff like that, you know?",
"And I would actually go, like,",
"I remember somebody warned me,",
must have been a friend of mine,
who was crazy early on the internet.,
"And they warned me, they called me up",
"and they went, ""there's some person,",
and they know where you walk every single day and you go,
down this back alley and they say,
that they're gonna jump on you and they're gonna rip,
your cerebral cortex out of your head.,
"So please don't go down that alley.""",
"So of course I was like, I'm going to that alley,",
I wanna see what happens.,
"Unfortunately, nothing.",
"I kept walking up and down it going, where are they?",
"Come on, what's, [laughing]",
but nothing ever happened.,
"Bruce Wayne/Batman, The Dark Knight Trilogy",
"Batman. I'm Batman. [man grunts] What a weirdo, right?",
Jumping around town at night in a bat outfit in many ways,
"in the same way that people were telling me, hey,",
"you can't go play Patrick Bateman, it's career suicide.",
"And I was like, bring it on. I'd definitely wanna do that.",
"Other people also said, hey, you know,",
"if you play Batman, that's it.",
You never gonna play anything else again.,
You will always be Batman.,
"And I went, bring it on.",
"Let's see if that happens 'cause I just always felt like,",
"look, if I don't have the skill",
"to be able to rise above that,",
then I don't deserve to either.,
I absolutely know and cherish the fact that will be the role,
"I'm probably remembered for most, you know, every reason.",
"Iconic, you know, larger than life role.",
But I don't view it really as being stopped in the street,
"and for me it was, ah, I could pay off my house.",
That's a huge relief. You know.,
That was a dream of mine since being a kid.,
"So, I really appreciate that.",
"I thank Chris Nolan, no end for that.",
"You know, the experience of actually working",
"with him, of course.",
"And we went on to make, you know, four films together.",
But the fact that that allowed me,
"to make so many other films, you know, for instance,",
"it took Mary a Herculean effort,",
which I so appreciate to get me cast,
in American Psycho post Batman.,
It got a little bit easier for directors to suggest me,
"and financiers to say, okay, yeah, we'll take him.",
You've got the wounded child who never moved on,
from the atrocity and tragedy that happens to him,
and he loses his parents.,
"And then the kind of monster that represents,",
"you know, all this anger and that he, you know,",
concentrates focuses into this character of the Batman.,
"And then the kind of charade,",
which is the Playboy apparently vacant,
and that no one would ever suspect of having,
any beliefs or causes ever in his life.,
Most of my recollection of making Batman is sitting doing,
crosswords by myself in a blue tent with very uncomfortable,
stuff on because they wanna be ready,
in 15 minutes at any given go.,
"So, I was always sitting there",
and these things going 4 down.,
"Hello, is anyone out there?",
"Yeah, I want you to know what I want you to do.",
"Come at me, me.",
"Heath Ledger, who, oh my God,",
"you know, what a performance,",
what a pleasure to have gotten to work with him,
"and just to see him, you know,",
and how much he put himself into the Joker.,
"And I, and I was watching it going,",
"yeah, this is absolutely fantastic.",
"Are we in trouble here of when Chris and I first sat down,",
"we said, not the problem.",
"What Batman is, is that the villains",
"are always more interesting, right?",
"And so Batman actually,",
he's very close to being a villain himself.,
"So, let's never let him become dull by comparison.",
"And unfortunately now sitting there go,",
I'm feeling a little bit dull,
but in comparison 'cause Heath is just,
"like killing this and, but I'm so proud of that film.",
"I love it. The Dark Night is absolutely extraordinary,",
"you know, and it was such a pleasure",
to have gotten to work with Heath.,
I don't wanna kill you.,
What would I do without you?,
Go back to a ripping off mob dealers?,
"No, no, no, no, you, you complete me.",
"You're garbage, you kills for money.",
Don't talk like one of them.,
You're not! Even if you'd like to be.,
"He, he was a wonderful go-kart driver racer.",
"Yeah, we went, we went and raced the go-karts and holy crap,",
he beat all the stunt guys and everything. He was quick.,
"When we went to the track,",
we thought of course the stunt guys are gonna win and,
"there's suddenly Heath wins, gets top place,",
"and then very quietly mentions,",
"you know, my dad was a go-kart racer.",
Very talented individual and a great soul to be around.,
"Yeah, I miss him greatly.",
Like he makes his presence felt all the time.,
I mean I spent so much time hanging out,
with Dicky beforehand and still in touch,
and still in touch with Dicky Jr.,
"Being in Lowell, hanging out with him,",
"going walking around, getting kicked out of bars,",
"having almost every cop stopping a gun, Hey, hey Dicky.",
And then telling me about a story about,
"when they arrested him, going to the boxing gym,",
"jumping in the ring, and sparring with him and oh my God,",
"it's really quite something when you,",
"you might think you can, ah, I'll be a decent boxer,",
you spar with other amateurs and whatnot.,
I've done that a few times.,
"but when you get in the ring with a pro, bloody hell.",
I remember one time he was sitting,
and he was reading the script,
and I was busy doing something else,
"and suddenly I see him like, stand up",
"and he starts walking over to David like,",
"I could see, you know,",
"something had happened and I went, Weed this ain't good.",
"Jumped over and said ""Dicky, Dicky Dicky what?""",
And just kind of talked him down because it was about,
"sort of, you know, hey look, when you tell someone's story,",
you gotta tell the good stuff,
"and you gotta tell the bad stuff,",
otherwise make no story there at all.,
It was the first film that I've made with David.,
And so getting to understand his process more.,
"And then, and then he's kind of enhanced that",
as we've made more films together and I loved it.,
I loved playing Dicky so much.,
"There were hilarious things and there was, you know,",
stuff to do with just sort of almost being,
shut down by the local cops and things like that.,
"But to me, that's all part of the fun of it.",
The Machinist,
The Machinist.,
You okay.,
Don't I look okay.,
"Brad, when I turned up was really stunned",
at how much weight I'd lost.,
"He went, oh you really did it.",
"Like he didn't think I really was going to,",
"that was just a, a outward show of his guilt",
"and being eaten alive, literally, you know, by guilt.",
I'd come off of making a couple of films that I'd been less,
than satisfied with and just really wanted something where,
I could become immersed and obsessed with it. You know?,
I mean I remember at the time it was like,
not the smart thing to do,
because there was no money in it,
"and it was like, oh bloody hell,",
I'm gonna lose my place or I'm living,
"and I was quite newly married and all that,",
so it wasn't the business smart thing to do.,
"But, I've never been smart in a business way.",
"But, it was something that I really wanted to",
challenge myself and kind of see could I achieve that?,
Could I fulfill how I imagined the part,
Trevor should be played?,
You know? And te and tested myself.,
Eh. Perfect fit,
A lot of times actually I would sit there,
"with headphones in, but I wasn't listening to anything.",
I was just pretending to listen,
"so that I could actually hear everything that was going on,",
but nobody thought I could.,
"Also, at the time I was engaged in a",
very filthy habit of smoking.,
"So, I was rolling my own cigarettes",
and sitting there puffing away.,
I did read numerous things.,
"I remember because the conversation with Brad, the director,",
"was I read Crime and Punishment,",
but then I was reading a lot Lighter Affair as well.,
The main point was that somehow,
losing all the physical weight,
put all the energy into my brain.,
And so I only slept two hours a night,
and all I wanted to do was read.,
And so I would just sit and read endlessly,
and I found that I could read without stopping,
and needing to move or get a distraction.,
I could ju I could just sit and read for 10 hours straight,
"without moving a muscle. Yeah, I can't do that now.",
The Big Short,
The Big Short.,
I've been very clear,
People will withdraw their money.,
Watch. That would be so stupid.,
"I mean if, if, if, if",
"if the funds capitals drop too much,",
then the swaps contracts are avoided and then the banks get,
"to keep all of the, all of it",
Wait a minute The contracts avoided?,
The contracts avoided?,
I had a wonderful day,
where we sat in his darkened office together,
and just chatted and they had scheduled all these things,
for us to go out and about and do different stuff,
and we ended up doing none of that,
'cause we just enjoyed talking with each other so much,
and had just an extraordinary day.,
And he was so helpful.,
"And then he came to visit the set and then, you know, we,",
we keep in touch from time to time,
and he's an extraordinarily special guy,
"and wow, what a role.",
"And also my first time working with Adam,",
"which I just loved, you know, he's, he, he's something else,",
"you know, he's like with David, you know,",
"when you get really great directors, they're very unique in,",
in the way that they work.,
[drums slamming],
"Anyone who plays drums can look and go,",
Christian doesn't play drums.,
But that to me was not the point.,
"The point was not that Michael Burry was a [beep] drummer,",
it was that he took his anger out on these drums and I did.,
I was just shattering the drumsticks.,
They were flying across. The crew had to all put shields up,
because so many of them were flying at speed.,
"Everybody, I love to get to interview people.",
I love to get to really study them in an obsessive way,
that you wouldn't get to usually that's part of,
"the joy of, of the job for me.",
"Dick Cheney, Vice",
Vice.,
"Sense that the, you're a kinetic leader,",
you make decisions based on instinct.,
I am. People always said that.,
"Yeah, yeah. Very different.",
Very different from uh from your father in that regard.,
"All right,",
let's dig a bit deeper and go do the very unlikely thing of,
"me played Dick Chaney, which I was like, what Adam? Them?",
Are you high?,
Usually they don't allow special effects makeup artists,
that much time to prep.,
"But I said, no, wait, we've gotta have,",
"you know, months and months and months to,",
to get anywhere close to something that can work here,
"because it's, it's the movement.",
"You know, thank God, you know,",
had people who were patient enough with me to just kind of,
keep going and keep going and keep going until eventually,
"go all right I think, I think we're in the realm.",
"A wonderful experience working, you know, with Adam,",
he uses a mic and we'll kind of just chuck out lines,
and chuck out ideas and try saying this instead.,
"Not improvising, but like, you know,",
suggesting lines and nudging you in the right direction.,
But you gotta be prepared to pivot and be on your toes,
even though Chaney's very not somebody,
who you would think of as being on his toes.,
He's very much like flat footed.,
"But yeah, no, really enjoyed the immersion that that took,",
"you know, even though",
"it was like four hours in the chair and whatnot,",
"I had never believed that it, it,",
it could be possible that I could play him.,
"And to, to, to give it a shot",
"is just a, was a wonderful risk.",
You have authorization to shoot down,
any aircraft deemed a threat.,
Presidential authority.,
That is correct. All orders are UNODIR.,
UNODIR?,
Unless otherwise directed.,
"Mr. Vice president, are we sure these",
are the proper rules of engagement?,
"The country is under attack, the ROE is fluid.",
"Well, he was very brilliant, you know, he is,",
he he is a brilliant man.,
"You know, he, whether, whether you agree with",
"what he, his intent, you know, was and is,",
is absolute brilliance in intelligence there.,
"You know, he rose incredibly quickly for good reason.",
"He, he understood the machinery of,",
of politics better than anyone else did.,
And so he could manipulate that.,
And for someone who was absolutely awful,
"at like retail politics, you know,",
he had no interested in kissing babies or whatever.,
He was very interested in the true mechanics of power,
"and, and how that works.",
"And he's, he is nobody better at it than him,",
Empire of the Sun,
Empire of the Sun,
Mom?,
Mom?,
Mom!,
Mommy!,
"Man. What an adventure. Yeah, it was something else.",
I got to not go to school and travel about by myself,
and I had no idea just how unique,
that experience was at the time because I didn't realize,
that every film didn't build a bloody runway.,
The planes could land on in the middle of a marshland,
"in Spain or build a pagoda or build a, you know,",
huge hospitals to build literally,
half a full size stadium out there.,
I didn't realize every film didn't travel to China,
"and have, you know, 10,000 extras up and down the bun.",
"You know, it wasn't until later",
"when I was on much smaller films,",
"I went, oh yeah, oh, that was a big one.",
Which I think was great in that way because I didn't really,
feel any pressure and at that age I didn't really feel like,
an actual film was gonna come out of it at the end.,
I was just in the moment doing it.,
Animals and children are the best actors.,
You can't compete with them.,
And the reason is because,
they don't give a [beep] about the consequences.,
And in many ways that was how I felt,
"when I was making a part of the sun, you know,",
"not through any intentional thing,",
it just didn't even enter my mind.,
"Three twenty nines?  Yeah, the super fortress,",
what we call a hemisphere defense weapon.,
"Where from?  Okinawa, Philippines,",
Tokyo is in bombing range now  Tokyo?,
Time to think of going home soon.,
There's a great purity to just play in a role.,
And that's it. Because every kid does it.,
"Every, every kid I still consider that I,",
"I play dress up for a living, you know?",
And kids do that naturally.,
It only gets spoiled when adults come in,
and ruin it by bringing money and expectations,
"and you should do more, et cetera.",
That's when things go wrong.,
"I never felt that while I was filming, you know, I mean,",
"there were times because I left my family, et cetera, they,",
they weren't able to come with me.,
"So I, you know, I'd be like in the airport, you know,",
"I'd cry my eyes out going, I don't want to go.",
"But when I got there, man, I was loving it",
and I was enjoying it. No end.,
"But then it was, it was when I started doing the press,",
I didn't get that.,
I couldn't understand that and I didn't understand why,
I had to keep talking about the same thing all day long,
and I was starting to go insane,
and then people follow me around or whatever.,
"And so that was when I went,",
"oh no, this isn't, this isn't for me.",
"But I always focused on going, yeah,",
"but I really did love doing it itself,",
so let's try to figure it out,
so I can deal with this part of it,
"and not have to stop doing the,",
the bit that I really do enjoy.,
"There's a price for everything and it's a, it's a,",
"once you get your head around it,",
it's a very small price to pay for getting to tell stories.,
And I recognize and I'm so grateful,
"for what I do get to, to do",
Amsterdam,
How can I know this is you really in the picture?,
"Yes sir. So, well I'm the dog there, she's the nurse,",
"he's the attorney. We all met in Belgium,",
which if you recall is where we met for the first time.,
"To Burt someone who's in, in experimental medicine",
"and likewise so with his brace, you know,",
it's something that he hates but he can't be without because,
"he's got such terrible injuries, you know,",
to his back and his spine and everything like that.,
"So, nah, I just kept on all the time because you see,",
"you see it through the, the suit you know,",
it's kind of like two little bumps of the metal,
"sticking out, you know?",
"And, and if I can avoid acting, I do avoid acting.",
"Like if you can just really do it and be uncomfortable,",
why bother pretending to be uncomfortable?,
Just be uncomfortable.,
"It was a practical thing because you know, these,",
these were very rudimentary back braces.,
Not like anything he would get today.,
These were things that he had kind of made himself,
in the same way that he's working,
on creating medicine that can help these returning war vets,
who weren't given a damn bit of help.,
"You know, they were meant to be returning heroes",
and absolutely nobody treated him like that.,
"He was despicable and who were all suffering from PTSD,",
but nobody recognized that at all.,
"And terrible, terrible injuries,",
"but didn't have the right painkillers or,",
or anxiety pills or whatever.,
"David and I, we wanted to create characters that we loved,",
"that we wanted to hang out with,",
characters that just refused to be beaten down by life,
"despite everything that life was thrown at them,",
"that they remained optimistic,",
refused to be cynical whatsoever.,
Eyebrows up was kind of our mantra.,
"Where is my eye, Harold?",
Right here.  Yes.,
You leave me here with this invalid,
when you know very well,
that I think she should be hospitalized.,
It's for her own good.,
"I, I do remember that both of them",
looked a bit shell shocked on the very first day of work,
because they haven't worked with David before.,
"We'll film the script,",
but then he will just throw different lines of people,
or he'll just change the lines.,
"No, don't you say that. You're gonna say that now.",
And he'll be laying on the floor underneath here,
and then he'll crawl you in the scene over there,
and then he'll be up behind the camera over here,
"and then he'll just say, change everything and go do that.",
And I love it.,
"But, David would occasionally come to me",
when he saw someone was just sort of looking,
"like a deer calling headlights and say,",
"""Oh, can you go be the ambassador",
"and just explain how we're gonna do this?""",
"And then everyone got into it and,",
"and then it's really joyful and,",
"and just a very, very satisfying experience.",
And Margo and JD just embraced it.,
"You know, and then I would go off and, you know,",
"telephone him and go sound like a stalker, but I'll be like,",
"he's a dude, I'm following down the street.",
"Oh my god, but he's fantastic.",
"I'm gonna use this for Bernie. He's like, great.",
"And then I tell him that mannerisms from different people,",
"attitudes, you know,",
it was all kind of very baked in and over years.,
So it was wonderful about that is,
"that by the time you're actually filming,",
it's really in your bones.,
The Pale Blue Eye,
Pale Blue Eye.,
There's so many good actors.,
I tell you lately I've been so blessed with the different,
amount of talented actors I've gotten to work with.,
"And so it was a real pleasure to work with all them,",
but let me just focus on one and that would be Harry Melling,
'cause Harry is just a really superb actor.,
"And so I, I just, I just enjoy it any day",
"that we got to do scenes together,",
Scott Cooper and I have worked together,
now is our third film.,
I love working with Scott and this was something that we've,
been talking about since like 2012,
that he had been putting together.,
He is prolific beyond belief in terms of his writing.,
He went and did different things.,
"I went and did different things, but just the period of it,",
"the gothic sort of crime nature of it,",
the sort of fun origin story of Edgar Allen Poe,
and what might have made him into,
such a Master of the Macabre,
and why he was so comfortable,
and enjoyed that way of thinking,
"and trying to think about, okay, well what, what,",
let's create a character,
that could have inspired all of that.,
And that also keeps in the vein of an,
Edgar Allen Poe's story itself as well.,
"So, and I think Scott Stanley's superb job again with that.",
