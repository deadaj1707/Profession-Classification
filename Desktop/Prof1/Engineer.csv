ladies and gentlemen I have a dream a,
dream that we can end poverty something,
I'm sure that we all share but to do,
that we have to change the conversation,
about poverty today I'm going to take us,
across the bridge that separates hype,
from reality and the bridge is,
engineering I'm going to retrace part of,
my journey seeking an answer to a simple,
question what do engineers do now I've,
been practicing and teaching engineering,
for 40 years nearly and I've spent the,
last 10 on research looking for answers,
to that simple question you might think,
it a bit impertinent of me to be,
teaching engineering without a clear,
idea of what engineers do but I'm only,
one of tens of thousands doing the same,
around the world and no one else pretty,
much thought to ask that simple question,
so this quest started with the support,
of my family in Pakistan my hair was,
going gray with frustration I was,
employing local engineers to try out,
better ways to clear land mines in,
Afghanistan working alongside Afghan tea,
miners and here by the way is a real,
landmine if you'd like to try one out,
don't worry it's been disarmed,
Engineers,
soldiers Taliban farmers children all,
were having their legs blown off and,
worse and some still are today now my,
engineers came with the best,
qualifications some from the best,
British universities and yet they didn't,
seem to show the kind of practical,
skills that I could take for granted,
from engineers in Australia at first I,
thought it was something to do with me,
being born in the country of their,
former colonizers they were taking,
revenge but then eventually I realized,
it wasn't me after all engineers across,
indian pakistan were performing much the,
same in the words of one pakistan,
politician a miracle is an engineer who,
delivers anything useful,
Water,
now 911 came and the Afghan tea miners,
based in Pakistan all went home and,
since then they've been more concerned,
about not being kidnapped than finding,
better ways to do their jobs at the,
inspiration of my dear late,
mother-in-law we turned our attention to,
water supplies in nearby villages and,
schools I have a picture of a school,
called tanda pani cool water ironically,
there are water pipes in the ground but,
no water was coming out until we,
installed a water pump in a well at the,
school the kids had to carry buckets for,
an hour a day just to use the toilets,
nearby in another village where they'd,
also asked for a water pump my language,
skills gradually improving a family,
insisted I join them for a cup of tea as,
I entered their tiny family walled,
compound they proudly showed me their,
water pump and told me that they had,
"spent the equivalent of $1,500",
installing it I was astonished here were,
really poor people how could they,
possibly afford that kind of money,
Economics,
well economists helped me understand,
that equation before they installed the,
water pump the women had to carry,
buckets back from the village well I,
won't around about a 1 hour round trip,
the economists explained the concept the,
shadow' priced value of time it's how,
people value their unpaid labor and,
roughly relates to what a woman could,
earn currently that village today it's,
about 30 cents an hour now when you,
figure out the time they spend carrying,
water and the extra hour required to,
boil it the cost of the fuel the cost of,
the water turns out to be $35 a ton and,
in case you're wondering what a ton of,
water is it's around about what it would,
take to fill two large bathtubs to the,
overflow,
Water supply,
there are other ways to get water in a,
city you can order it in 20 litre,
plastic bottles it's more reliable its,
cleaner safer to drink and the cost $70,
a ton now the city water supply is,
intermittent it's run by engineers costs,
$20 in a year and will deliver water to,
you for an hour or so every other day,
water that is almost certainly,
contaminated by sewage that seeps in,
through thousands of broken and half,
repaired connections that cross open,
sewers now of course you can drink that,
water but you take the equivalent,
economic penalty sickness for several,
weeks a year cuts into your earning,
potential now it's important to realize,
that these costs for most people are not,
paid in cash it's a loss of capacity,
they pay in time and lost opportunities,
now let's go back for a moment let's,
think about the minimum quantity water,
you need to survive in a UN refugee camp,
they'll give you 10 liters of water per,
day which will be just enough for,
cooking and drinking and the other,
things you need clean water for what,
does it cost therefore to provide this,
minimum quantity of water to 170 million,
people in Pakistan every day answer,
Cost,
using the estimates that I've given you,
10 percent of GDP yes and that doesn't,
include food every day up and down the,
country women spend their entire days,
carrying water for their families and,
their animals the cost counts,
enroll pindy medical specialists tell me,
that 95% of the sickness cases they see,
every day could be prevented by washing,
hands and backsides and for Muslims,
that's a religious requirement so why is,
it that most people avoid what is both a,
religious and a health requirement,
answer they can't afford the water it's,
too expensive and we're not just talking,
about Pakistan where people are poor,
because of this hideously high cost of,
water we're not just talking about water,
Food,
either think about food,
India and Pakistan grow three times as,
much food as they actually eat the rest,
is lost because of inadequate,
engineering food is lost in storage,
distribution in processing and in,
manufacture with the electricity off for,
18 or more hours a day in summer a,
fridge is a mere decoration,
you can't keep today's leftovers because,
they won't last till tomorrow with,
temperatures over 30 degrees all the,
time and if you want to have a generator,
it'll cost you 50 cents a kilowatt hour,
and that's far more than most people can,
afford so think about this all the,
countries that we think as being low,
cost countries countries with low-cost,
labor where our manufacturing industry,
might go to they're actually hideously,
expensive to live in and that's why most,
of the people are poor so why is it so,
much cheaper for us here today well many,
people will tell you that us that is the,
Western colonial powers of the 18th 19th,
and early 20th century we manipulated,
the world economy impoverished our,
colonies and enriched our,
great-grandparents we developed some,
impressive engineering and then we,
squandered,
most of the loot because we had a nasty,
habit of going to war with each other we,
came to our senses we started competing,
economically once the trade barriers,
enforced by empires came tumbling down,
and the competition that ensued fostered,
and an extraordinary improvements in,
engineering improvements which slashed,
the real costs of living for us vastly,
reducing the amount of resources and,
human effort required for water food,
energy and the comfortable lifestyle,
we've come to enjoy so what this does,
Human capacity,
what this engineering does is liberate a,
huge amount of human capacity human,
capacity that can be used for governance,
improved security education health care,
even volunteering sport recreation the,
things that we enjoy in a civilized,
existence but where does this leave the,
developing world well they've got the,
message they're educating hundreds of,
thousands millions of Engineers across,
India China Pakistan and many other,
countries but will these engineers be,
able to deliver what their people expect,
with ten years research on engineering,
practice I'm having my doubts let's take,
the case of Indian engineers the best,
Marginal product,
Indian engineers don't work as engineers,
they get jobs as programmers writing,
software why well that's a question that,
troubles Indian manufacturers today how,
can they compete we are they asked when,
software companies pay our engineers,
three times what we can afford,
once again economists provide a handy,
concept it's called marginal product it,
explains that what you get paid roughly,
equates to the,
you that you contribute to the,
organization that you work in so these,
young engineers who end up writing,
software contribute far more value doing,
something for which they have not been,
trained compared with engineering for,
Engineering education,
which they've supposedly been educated,
now the engineering education which is,
following the same curriculum as I have,
been teaching consists almost entirely,
of mathematics and engineering science,
it blinds them to the distribution of,
human know-how finance precedent and,
social influence these are the realities,
that shape the contours of engineering,
feasibility in the real world now in our,
Stroke of luck,
research we had a stroke of luck we,
managed to find a tiny number of expert,
engineers in South Asia who have taught,
them taught themselves advanced and,
highly effective practice skills they,
earn salaries higher than their,
counterparts in Australia and America,
because they contribute a great deal of,
value for the organizations that employ,
them in fact they make their,
organizations work thanks to our,
research we can start to understand what,
these practical skills really are now,
it's important to understand what the,
potential of this idea really is the,
practice research which we've been doing,
here has opened up enormous,
opportunities we're also inventing some,
Charles OConnor,
interesting technology like localized,
air conditioning that can reduce the,
energy requirement for personal comfort,
by 80 or 90 percent and in all of this I,
have been inspired by a truly great,
engineer Charles Yelverton O'Connor,
he transformed Western Australia a,
century ago his suicide has perhaps,
ensured that we remember his legacy more,
than many others with comparable,
achievements he was described by those,
who knew him as a genius possessing,
extraordinary insight when O'Conner,
arrived in Western Australia water on,
the Kalgoorlie Gold Fields cost two,
shillings a gallon because it had to be,
carried hundreds of kilometers were,
distilled in vast condensers now at that,
time to get ten liters of water would,
take some around two-thirds of a typical,
workers pay as I said on the slide $70,
for ten liters you need to survive on so,
a Conor proposed a 530 kilometre,
pipeline from near Perth to the cog Rd,
Gold Fields it was to be larger and far,
longer than any other pipeline then in,
existence he estimate it will cost two,
and a half million pounds and take five,
years to build the achievement was,
extraordinary partly because he was,
building this pipeline about as far as,
you could get from the industrialized,
centres of the world at that time he,
prepared these estimates before he even,
had a map now in order to bring the,
project in he had to be extremely tough,
on the contractors and the contractors,
didn't take it lying down they,
complained bitterly to their friends and,
relatives,
remember that Perth at the time had a,
"population of only 25,000 people and",
this was the equivalent of taking on a,
multi-billion dollar project today,
imagine that in a town a small town,
well the contractors were related by,
blood or marriage to newspaper,
proprietors and members of parliament,
who in turn made life so stressful for,
O'Connor that as we know ultimately,
he took his own life the pipeline was,
Conclusion,
completed a year after his death give or,
take and it was operating at its design,
capacity with less than 8% over run on,
the original budget now consider that,
how many projects today,
particularly of that magnitude and,
advancing technology so far beyond the,
state-of-the-art how many projects come,
in anywhere near the original budget,
today well the reason is ladies and,
gentlemen because we have lost so much,
of our practice skills but thanks to our,
research we can begin to rebuild those,
skills in fact that's what we have been,
doing and now let's go back the high,
costs of water food and energy across,
the developing world represent a,
humanitarian catastrophe nothing less,
these costs are denying billions of,
people from enjoying a decent lifestyle,
but this catastrophe is also an,
opportunity now here in Western,
Australia we have some amazing,
opportunities for engineers today with,
the right skills and yet not far away,
there are opportunities hundreds of,
times greater again a new generation of,
Engineers equipped with up-to-date,
practice skills could not only liberate,
billions of people from destitution but,
also they can build big good businesses,
for themselves so this new generation of,
engineers ladies and gentlemen this new,
generation of engineers equipped with,
practice know-how can awaken vast human,
potential as yet unrealized that's my,
Dream,
This is the Hernando de Soto Bridge that carries traffic on I-40,
"over the Mississippi River between Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee.",
"In May of last year, a team of engineers hired to inspect the superstructure,",
"that's the truss work above the roadway,",
happened to notice a crack in a structural member below the deck.,
"This crack passed almost all the way through one of the arched eyes,",
which are considered fracture-critical members.,
"In other words, you lose this member, you lose the entire bridge.",
"Recognizing the severity of the situation,",
"the engineers immediately called 911 and had the bridge shut down,",
"and it stayed shut down,",
"this critical link between two states,",
for more than three months while repairs were completed.,
It was complete luck that engineers hired to inspect,
a different part of the bridge happened to notice the crack,
and recognize its severity before it turned into a disaster.,
"And if a bridge that looks like this,",
that serves as an iconic part of the landscape,
"and a vital link over a major river, can experience such a blatant oversight,",
"not to mention a violation of federal bridge safety standards,",
how much confidence does that give you,
"in the safety of a bridge that looks like this,",
something you're much more likely to drive over in your daily commute?,
Infrastructure doesn't last forever.,
"Most projects are designed with a lifespan of 50 to 100 years,",
"which means a lot of the stuff that we've built over the past century,",
"and we built a lot of stuff, is starting to show signs of its age.",
The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates right now we're spending,
just around half of what's needed to maintain a state of good repair.,
And that bill is eventually going to come due.,
"Just the past few months,",
we've seen a bridge collapse in Pittsburgh,
and a citywide boil water notice in Austin,
because of problems at the treatment plant.,
What's worse is that waiting to address these problems,
"until it becomes absolutely necessary, like after a major failure,",
"is far more costly, disruptive, and risky",
than just keeping up with regular maintenance over time.,
You don't need a civil engineer to tell you an ounce of prevention,
is worth a pound of cure.,
Underinvestment in infrastructure's a thing we're somewhat familiar with.,
We see headlines about it regularly.,
Major federal legislation last year brought it into the spotlight,
and is hopefully a big step towards turning the problem around.,
"Still, politicians, planners, and government officials at every level",
face an uphill battle in getting the public,
interested and involved in infrastructure.,
"It's either too boring, too complicated, or both.",
"We need to understand our connection to the constructed environment,",
"in order to care for it and invest in it,",
which means we need to know a little bit about how it works.,
"We grow up with all this infrastructurearound us,",
taking most of it so for granted that we hardly even realize it's there.,
"These elements of our environment that meet our basic needs of clean air,",
"fresh water, sanitation, and transportation,",
they're practically invisible to us.,
"They're hidden in plain sight,",
and I think that solving our problems with infrastructure,
starts with just opening our eyes to the constructed environment.,
Let me show you just a quick example of what I mean:,
This is a picture that I took right outside my house. Anyone recognize this?,
"A utility pole, right? You've probably seen thousands of these in your lifetime.",
"But with a show of hands,",
"how many of you have ever taken a good, hard look at one of these?",
Like for more than 30 seconds?,
I don't see many hands.,
Keep your hands up if you can tell me what every single one of those wires does.,
Not very many.,
"On the surface, it seems like a utility pole serving a fairly simple,",
some might even say utilitarian purpose,
of distributing power to homes and businesses.,
But the truth is a little bit more complicated,
and I think more interesting and engaging than that.,
So let me tell you just a few of the things,
"that I see when I look at these ubiquitous objects,",
and I think you're going to walk out of the room,
looking at these poles just a little bit differently.,
"Distributing electricity isn't that complicated,",
"it all happens on wires, but if you want to move",
"a lot of electricity to every single home and business in an entire city,",
"it's much more cost-effective to use high voltage,",
like in the thousands of volts.,
"But high voltage is dangerous because the electricity can jump across gaps,",
so we have to keep these energized lines high up off the ground,
at the very top of these poles.,
"And electricity is normally distributed in three individual phases,",
so in commercial areas you'll see them run together like this.,
"And in residential areas sometimes they split the phases apart,",
"and so you might see one, two, or three energized lines at the top of a pole,",
plus a return wire to complete the circuit we call neutral.,
You can't just set high voltage lines directly on a wooden crossbar,
"because wood isn't a good insulator, especially when it gets wet,",
so we use ceramic insulators to isolate the energized lines from the pole,
and keep the electricity from using it as a short circuit to ground.,
"But if an energized line does come into contact with something on the pole,",
"it can create a shock hazard to people below or start a fire,",
so we also include ground wires along each pole as a safety measure.,
"Now we have power to the pole, but it still has to reach the customers.",
"Every connection from the grid to a home or business is called a service drop,",
"but we can't send high voltage into buildings,",
again because it's too dangerous.,
"So we have to take that high voltage and lower it to a lower level,",
"and we do that using transformers, very simple devices,",
essentially two coils of wire and a can of oil.,
"But even though they're simple devices, transformers are expensive,",
so we install fuses to protect them against surges and faults,
like lightning strikes and wayward squirrels.,
That's just the electricity part.,
There's also other utilities that need to reach individual homes and businesses,
"like cable, telephone, and fiber optic lines.",
"We already have these poles, so we string them along, too, in many cases,",
"but we don't want our cable and telephone technicians being shocked,",
so we include a safety space below the energized lines for them to work.,
"And all these cables and wires create a lot of stress on a pole,",
so we also include guy wires,
in some cases to balance the forces and keep things upright.,
"I could keep going, but I'm running out of room on my diagram here",
"and I know this is kind of a mess, but that's kind of the point, right,",
"because hopefully you're seeing now that even the simple utility pole,",
"one of the most basic pieces of infrastructure out there,",
"is really a monument to the solutions of 100 practical engineering problems,",
all of which are out there right in the open for anyone to have a look.,
And noticing even just a few of these details,
and understanding even just a tiny bit about how these things work,
can convert the act of looking at infrastructure,
from a mundane inevitability into an everyday diversion and joy.,
My wife sometimes accuses me of having my head in the clouds,
when I was looking at a cool piece of equipment,
at the top of a utility pole or antenna tower.,
"When the news came out about the Hernando de Soto Bridge crack last year,",
it reminded a gentleman of a kayak trip he took on the Mississippi River in 2016.,
"He went home, looked through his photos, and found one that included the bridge.",
"Sure enough, you could see the crack from the water below.",
This was five years before that team of engineers,
noticed a crack and sounded the alarms.,
"I think there's some big lessons here for state DOTs involved in this incident,",
"but I think there's a lesson here for us, too,",
because even though that crack was invisible,
to the roughly 100 million vehicles that passed over the bridge,
"during those five years, it was visible to anyone on the water below.",
And not a single person had ever been curious enough,
to look up where they might have noticed and reported it.,
"Now, I'm not saying we should all be ad hoc structural engineers",
"observing the conditions of every bridge we cross over,",
but I do think that we all have some responsibility,
for how the world gets built around us.,
Investment in infrastructure,
requires that we care for it and appreciate it first.,
And an easy way to do that is just to look up.,
Thank you.,
"Yeah, it's great to be back.",
I think it's been maybe 10 years since I first joined,
Google right out of school. I joined the search quality team.,
"And since leaving Google, I've worked at a bunch of different startups, including Ooyala, Quora, and Qup.",
"And two of those were actually founded by former Googlers. And so, even though I've been away",
"from Google for quite some time, Google culture has actually been a large part of the various startups",
"that I worked at. And earlier this year, I did publish a book, ""The Effective",
"Engineer."" And what I like to do during this talk is share with you some of the stories and lessons",
that I've collected during these experiences. And so my promise to you during this talk,
is that you sort of walk away with a framework and a set of actual strategies that you can apply to your day,
"to day job on how to become more effective as an engineer. But, before we dive into the meat of the talk,",
I want to do a quick poll and get a show of hands. Who here has pulled a long night on a project for work before?,
Who here has done that-- who's done work on the weekends before? A large number.,
"Who here has worked multiple months on a project, only",
to see maybe it not actually launch? What about working multiple months on a project and then,
"see it launch, but not actually sort of seeing the impact or the effect that you actually wanted?",
And let's do one more.,
Who here has to do pager duty? And how many of you have been paged in the middle of night,
"or over the weekends before? Yeah, so it's a good number of people.",
"And when this stuff happens, a lot of times we sort of wonder,",
"was all this time and energy, was it worth it? Was this actually the best use of my time?",
And this isn't a question that you just sort of ask at Google. It's also questions that we ask at other places as well.,
"I remember when I left Google, the week immediately afterwards, I jumped-- dove head first",
into my first startup. I didn't even take a week of break.,
And this first startup was Ooyala. It was an online video company focused on building,
"a platform for the enterprise. It was founded by a former Googler. I remember my very first week, the CTO told me,",
"you're responsible for building this feature that's already been promised to a paying customer. And the video player has written an actionscript,",
because it was a Flash based video player. And it was a language that I didn't know. The servers were all written in Ruby,
"on Rails, which I had no familiarity with. And there was not a single unit test",
"across the entire codebase. And so, I was really scared of just accidentally breaking",
"something production. And so, my first two weeks there, I ended up pulling 70 to 80 hour weeks to try to get that done.",
"And when I want to talked to my CTO about how intense this felt, his response was sink or swim.",
There's no life preserver coming. You're just going to have to work hard. And that was a very intense and very stressful,
"time in my career. And so, the next startup I joined wasn't all that different.",
"When I join Quora, which was a question answer site, the jobs page actually read, you should",
be ready to make this startup the primary focus of your life. That's sort of how intense the culture was.,
"And that time, all of these narratives about how you need to work hard to succeed sort of really",
"lined up with how we were thinking. My team and I, we really wanted to succeed. But at the same time, we knew we were the underdogs.",
"While we were building an online video platform for the enterprise, YouTube was free.",
"Our biggest competitor, Brightcove, dominated most of the market.",
"And so we thought, one of our secret weapons was that we're just going to outwork everyone else. We're going to work so hard that we're",
"going to overcome all these obstacles and actually succeed. And it took a while before I started wondering,",
was this actually the best use of our time? Because we worked on projects where we'd spend multiple months building a future for a paying,
"customer, but then they would never use it. Or at Quora, we'd build content tools.",
And it just wouldn't get the adoption from users that we actually wanted.,
"There were all these things where we spent so much time on these projects, by the end of day,",
"it didn't really lead to any impact. And so, we started sort of wondering, can we actually work smarter?",
Can we deliver significantly more value while working fewer hours?,
And it's sort of like after doing years of actually working these crazy hours before I had this key insight that effort,
"doesn't really equal impact. You may have good intentions, but those good intentions",
don't actually lead to results. Think about a staff engineer at Google.,
"They probably produce more than twice the impact or twice the output of a more junior engineer,",
but they're probably not working 2x the hours. Or think about Jeff Dean.,
"So, I heard Google had to sort of invent some new engineering level for him, like senior Google fellow.",
He probably produces more than 10x the impact of most of us in this room. But he's not working 10x the hours,
"because that's physically impossible. There aren't that many hours in the day. And so, the notion that effort is",
"sort of what determines our impact isn't really a correct one, and we need a better framework",
for the really understanding and thinking and reasoning about impact and effectiveness.,
"And so, that's sort of where I sort of came upon this principle of leverage, where leverage",
is defined as impact that you produce for the time that you invest.,
It's the rate of return on your investment of time and energy. It's the ROI. It's the rate of impact.,
"If you think about the Pareto Principle, the 80-20 Rule, it's the 20% of work that actually",
"produces 80% of the results. Those are the tasks, those are the activities that actually",
"are extremely high leverage. Now, sort of a central thesis that I want you to take away",
from this talk is that this central concept of leverage is really the guiding metric that effective engineers should,
"use to determine how and where to spend their time. Now, it might seem a little obvious and maybe",
"a little simple to some of us, but the same time, oftentimes",
"we're so engrossed in what we're doing, we're so focused on the project that we're working on",
"that we don't really take the time to ask, are we working the right thing? We're attending meetings.",
"That might not be the best use of our time. Or we're fixing the next urgent bug, or we're just fighting the next fire.",
Or we're working on projects that end up not shipping or not going anywhere.,
"And we don't really take a step back to think about, was our time on these projects actually well spent?",
Were those activities actually high leverage? And you can think about if you're walking along the road,
"and you see a boulder, that boulder is really hard to move. But if you can find the right lever,",
"then you can apply just a little bit of force and move that boulder out of the way, because that lever amplifies your output.",
"In a similar way, in software engineering, we're looking for those levers where we can amplify our energy, our time and produce massive gains.",
"And so, the next question we might ask ourselves, given that we have this framework, is how do we actually apply it to engineering?",
What are the highest leverage activities for engineers? This is a question that I really personally wanted to answer.,
I knew that working 60 to 80 hour weeks simply wasn't sustainable. It wasn't going to help us win in our different markets.,
"Also, I'd spend a lot of time on engineering hiring and recruiting. And I'd screen thousands of resumes or interview",
"maybe 500 candidates. And I really want to know, how do we actually identify the most effective engineers to hire for our team?",
I'd also spent about maybe a year and a half building the on boarding and training programs,
for engineers at Quora. This was basically what every new engineer at Quora would go through.,
"And I wanted to know, how do we actually train engineers and teach them to be more effective?",
"And so, I really wanted to know the answer to this question. And so, that's what started me on a quest",
where I quit my job at Quora and then basically took two years to explore this question.,
And I went around Silicon Valley. I interviewed a bunch of engineering leaders from different companies.,
"So, VPs, directors, managers, tech leads, people from larger companies like Google, Facebook,",
"LinkedIn, Twitter. A few were from more medium size companies like Dropbox, Square, Airbnb, Box, Etsy.",
"And even smaller startups: Instagram, Reddit, Lyft at the time was pretty small.",
"And I grilled them. I asked them really hard questions. Asked them, what separates the most effective engineers",
you've worked with from everyone else? What are the most valuable lessons,
that you've learned in the past year? What investments have you made for your team that,
have paid the highest returns? I really wanted to know what from their experiences proved,
out to be the highest leverage activities that engineers everywhere should be focusing on.,
"And now 22 months later, I basically had a collection of stories, lessons, and actual strategies",
"on how to be more effective engineer. Now, everyone's story was different,",
"but there were a lot of common themes. And in this book, this is still a lot of those common themes through actual strategies",
that you and I can apply in our day to day jobs as engineers.,
"And so, what I'd like to do for the rest of this talk is actually share with you five of those high leverage",
activities for engineers that I think would be really useful for us to incorporate in our day,
to day jobs. The first high leverage activity really,
"starts in our own mindset, how we think about our own development as engineers.",
And that activity is optimizing for learning This Mantra is something that has guided all of my own career,
decisions. Every change I made from company to company or from company to writing a book was because I saw an opportunity,
to actually increase my learning rate. And this is really important because learning is something that actually compounds over time.,
What you learn today sets you up for other opportunities and other learning that you might have in the future.,
"And when I say that it compounds over time, I actually mean a few things. One, this curve of learning is actually exponential.",
"Just like if you were investing in your financial investments, your investment portfolio, your financial investments",
"compound over time exponentially. In a similar way, investments in yourself also do the same thing.",
"So, the second implication is that the earlier on in your career that you invest in yourself, the more time that learning",
has to compound the long run. And thirdly even small deltas in your learning rate,
can have tremendous impact on how much knowledge and how much learning you have in the long term.,
"And so, it's really hard actually to quantify how much we're learning, but suppose",
you actually could. Suppose you could actually improve yourself by 1% per day.,
"What would that mean? Well, it would mean by the end of the year, after 365 days,",
you'd actually be 37 times better than you were at the being of the year.,
That's a huge difference. And the best engineers and the best engineering leaders actually aggressively and relentlessly optimize,
"in their own learning. One of the pieces of advice Tamar Bercovici, who",
"is a senior engineering manager at Box, tells all of the engineers he manages, is to own your own story.",
"What she means by that is that you need to take control and take ownership of your own learning and growth,",
rather than waiting for opportunities to come to you and find opportunities to really invest in yourself.,
"Read books, take classes, work on side projects, attend talks.",
These are all ways that you can invest in yourself and then those investments will compound,
"in your career in the long run. And so, when you think about growing your career,",
ask yourself how might you improve yourself every single day? And commit to making a habit out of that.,
Now learning is one thing that compounds. But another thing that also compounds,
"and that also is very high leverage is actually investing in your own iteration speed, how quickly you can get things done.",
"The faster we can get things done, the more impact we'll have in the long run.",
"And because we're all engineers, one of the best ways that we can invest in our iteration speed",
"is actually by investing in tools. When I was talking with Bobby Johnson, who's",
"the former engineering director at Facebook, he made the observation to me that he",
"found that people who are successful, almost all of them wrote a lot of tools.",
He said the strongest engineers and his team spend probably a third of their time working on tools.,
"Tools to do monitoring, tools to make debugging easier, tools to just glue the system together.",
"But the surprising thing was that he said this wasn't actually obvious on his team. Because a lot of engineers, we like",
working on the new shiny tool. We want to be the author of some new system. We want to build this new data storage system,
"and be the author of that. When in reality, even more mundane tasks,",
"such as investing in tools and investing in your own iteration speed, can be extremely high leverage and have huge payoffs.",
"This is sort of the reason why a lot of big companies, Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Dropbox,",
"they all have teams the focus on development tools. Because if you can decrease bill times by, say,",
"even one minute per day and engineers are building, say, 10 times per day, and you have 1,000 engineers,",
that's a one engineering month saved per day. I remember when I joined Google back in 2006,
and I was compiling in a Google web server on search quality team. It was something that you kicked off and then you went home,
"and it compiled itself overnight. That's how long it took. And by the time I left in 2008, sort",
"of when Blaze was getting introduced, bill times I think dropped to around 20 minutes.",
And that was huge. I'm sure it's probably dropped down even further since then. I'm not sure how fast it is now.,
I see I see some shakes of the head. But all of these investments in bill times,
"are extremely high leverage. Because it means that you can, instead of doing things",
"in large batches, you're doing them more iteratively over time. One of the proudest accomplishments",
that we did while at Quora was we had a system where we could actually deploy code production 40 to 50 times per day.,
"For every time an engineer pushed to commit to get, it would automatically kick off a suite of a few thousand unit",
"tests. And if all those tests passed, that code would then ship to a canary machine, that would then",
"run another battery of tests. And if that passed, the code would be automatically shipped to all our webmachines production.",
"And that entire process only took six or seven minutes, which meant that we could push code production 40, 50 times",
"a day. And that changed deployments which, from any team to this one off event",
"that they have to do maybe every week, maybe even every day, to something that was a very normal part of a development.",
"And it meant if we had a question, how often is",
"this feature that's on our web page actually being used, it means that an engineer could just add a simple log line,",
"push that code to production, and then start getting some data back within minutes. So, a lot of these questions that",
"are impossible with a slower workflow, we were able to do because of a system of continuous deployment.",
"And you might wonder, when does it make sense for us to invest in tools?",
"And a good rule of thumb that I got from Raffi Krikorian, who grew the infrastructure team at Twitter",
"from about 50 engineers to 450 engineers, used to tell his team that if you have to do something",
"more than twice manually, you should build a tool for the third time. And that's a good rule of thumb, because we",
tend to underestimate how often we're going to need to manually do certain tasks.,
"Sometimes we get started, we do things manually because it seems to be simpler. And then requirements change, or we mess up",
during our manual steps. And then we end up spending a lot more time than we actually could have.,
"Instead, if we had invested in tooling and automation sooner, we could save ourselves a lot of time.",
"And so, when you're working on a project,",
"you should also always ask yourself, what are the events? What are the bottlenecks that you face during development?",
How can you speed those things up? Because all of those improvements will sort of compound in how fast,
"or how quickly you can get things done. You can also ask same question when you're debugging, as well.",
Say you're building an Android app and you're debugging this photo sharing flow that's a few clicks away from the home screen.,
"Could you wire up your flow so that when you start the app, you land right on that screen?",
Simple tweaks like to optimize your own debugging flow to really optimize your iteration speed can have a huge difference in the long run in how,
productive and effective you are I've talked a lot about how to get things done quickly.,
"But another important question to think about is not only how to get things done quickly,",
"but how to get the right things done quickly. And so, that's another key high leverage activity",
is actually validating your ideas aggressively and iteratively.,
And a good example of how to do this right as well as how to do this wrong actually comes from Etsy.,
"Etsy is a company that sells handmade goods online, and last year they hit almost $2 billion in revenue.",
And they had this one project where they were trying to build infinite scrolling,
"on the results page. So, when you type a query at Etsy, you see a bunch of product products.",
"And the product page is paged. And they were exploring, maybe we",
"should add infinite scrolling. Similar to how on Google Images, if you scroll down on the image",
"search page, results just sort of keep loading onto that page. And so they'd spent many months building this out,",
"ironing bugs, and just when they were about to ship, they decide, we should probably test this.",
"And so, they ran an AB test. And they found that click through rates actually dropped by 10%.",
"Purchase rates actually dropped by nearly 25%. So, there was no way they were going to actually launch",
this product. Then they actually spent some time trying to figure out why this wasn't working.,
"And they realized that for this product change to actually work, it sort of relies on two assumptions.",
"One is that if we show more results to users, they'll be more likely to buy products.",
"And the second is that if we show results faster to the users so that they don't actually have to page,",
they would also choose to buy more. But the key insight is that each of these assumptions,
"could have been independently validated with much less work. If the assumption is that if we show more results to users,",
"they will buy more, they could have just increased the page size. And in fact, when they did that after the fact,",
they found that that really had no impact on purchases. An assumption that maybe a faster page,
"will lead to more purchases, that's something a little bit harder to test. But they got a little creative. They artificially added some latency",
"to some fraction of users, made the page slower. And when they tried that test, they",
found out that also didn't have much of an impact. Each of those tests were much easier to run.,
"Very little engineering effort required. And if they had run those tests first, then they would have realized their basic assumptions",
"behind infinite scrolling didn't even prove out in the wild. And so, there was no real reason to actually invest all",
that time and effort to build infinite scrolling. They sort of took these lessons to heart,
"when they worked on a different project, which was rebuilding the product page when you click through",
on a search result. They actually went through 14 different iterations of this page when they were redesigning it.,
And they broke down the redesign project into a number of different testable assumptions.,
Does showing more related products on the page actually decrease bounce rate?,
"Does showing the price in your native currency, does that increase purchases?",
Does showing a default shipping option and the price of a default shipping option make a difference?,
"Does swapping sides of the page make a difference? They broke down each of these assumptions, each",
"of these hypotheses, and tested each one. And there were a bunch of ones that didn't work.",
"They failed. But, all of the information that they collected from these 14",
"different tests helped them build confidence in theories about which changes did matter,",
"which ones did make an impact. And so with that, they were able to launch a redesign",
"that when I talked to Mark Hedlund, who was the former VP of product engineering at Etsy,",
he said that this was actually the single largest experimental win in Etsy's history. It was the most successful project,
that they launched in terms of purchasing performance. And it was only possible because they,
"learned that experiment driven product design is a very powerful tool. Now, this is something that I think,",
"at least when I was in search quality, Google did pretty well. They run a lot of AB tests. They sort of validate a lot of changes",
to prove these changes are actually improving searches and improving the bottom line.,
But another take away from Etsy is that incrementally validating your assumptions,
is a very high leverage technique. If you can break down a large problem into smaller testable,
"hypotheses, and then evaluate each one, you can really build confidence in what works",
"and what doesn't work. Or if a test proves that your assumption is correct, then you have more confidence that the path you're going down",
"is the right path. If it proves your assumption is incorrect, then that means you maybe need to revise your project plan.",
"At the very least, this could save you months of effort.",
"And in startups, there is this idea of focusing on the minimal viable product.",
What's the smallest version of the product that takes the least amount of effort to build that you can,
"show to real users and get feedback and validation that what you're building, what you're designing",
"is actually the right thing to do? That's a very powerful idea. Now something, while Google, especially search,",
"it does a good job with their AB testing, I think the idea of building this minimal viable product",
"is an idea that they can definitely leverage more. Because a lot of times at Google,",
"we sort of build products for speed. We optimize for performance, we optimize for scale",
"rather than really focusing and asking a question. Like, is this product actually the right thing to build in the first place?",
Because it doesn't matter if something is really performance if it's not the right thing that users actually want.,
"One of the good rules of thumb that I got from Zach Brock,",
"who was an engineer manager at Square, is that he would constantly ask his engineers, what's",
"the scariest part of the project that you're working on? That's the part of the most unknowns, the most risks.",
That's the part you should actually tackle first. Because you want to reduce and tackle the risk,
"head on so that if it proves that these risky areas are there aren't doable or don't impact your bottom line,",
"you can cut your losses short and move on. And so, when you're working on projects,",
"you should really ask yourself, can you break this down into smaller testable hypotheses?",
Can you use an inexpensive test to validate that what you're doing is the right thing?,
How might you expend 10% of your effort upfront to validate that the project you're working on,
will actually work? Because that 10% is a very high leverage use of your time.,
It can save you months of wasted effort further on.,
"Validation definitely is very important and can save you wasted effort. But another powerful technique, another high leverage activity",
"that can help you reduce wasted effort, is this idea of minimizing operational burden.",
"A lot of times, we spend so much time maintaining and operating our software that we don't really have time",
to actually build new things.,
"And if we can minimize the operational burden that we actually have on a day to day basis, we can spend a lot more time actually focusing on impact.",
And a great story which really illustrate this point comes from Instagram. When they were acquired in 2012 by Facebook,
"for a billion dollars, they actually only had a team of 13 employees. And of those 13 employees, only five of them were engineers.",
"They had a really small team supporting over 40 million users. So by any metric, this was a pretty effective team.",
"And I was curious, what was it that allowed the Instagram",
"team to be that effective? And so, I sat down with Mike Krieger, the co-founder",
"of Instagram, and I asked him, was there any secret sauce to this? What was your key technique?",
And he said one of the most important mantras that they had on Instagram was to do the simple thing first.,
"They actually had this on posters in the office. During design meetings, when someone",
"was proposing a new feature, they would actually challenge each other, is this the simplest thing",
"that we can do? If not, why are we adding all this complexity?",
"The key insight here was that every feature they added, every system they added, was another potential fire",
"that they might have to put out in the future. And with such a small team, they couldn't afford to spend all that time just putting out fires.",
And they were very aggressive and very stringent about cutting sources of complexity. And this actually a very common theme.,
"And I mentioned in the beginning of how I went around and asked a lot of leaders, what's the most valuable lesson you've learned the past year?",
"And it turns out that a lot of engineering leaders, including Mike Curtis, who is the head of engineering",
"at Airbnb, or Chris Lambert, who's the CTO of Lyft, and a bunch of other leaders, all said that they wished they had made things simpler.",
They wish they hadn't added so much complexity in the last year. And the reason why this was such a common theme,
is because we often ignore the hidden costs that are associated with complexity.,
"When you introduce sources of complexity, we're actually introducing an ongoing tax that we have to pay as we develop software in the future.",
"And this tax actually comes in a variety of forms. On the most basic level, there's code complexity.",
"That when we're dealing with a very complex code, it's hard to ramp up on. It's hard to understand.",
"It's hard to reason about. And as engineers, sometimes we see complex code and then we tiptoe around it.",
"We decide, we're not going to touch this code base because it's a little hairy. And then, we miss out on opportunities to actually build",
things that might be impactful. Or we do things in a roundabout way just so that we can avoid the complex piece of code.,
"Besides code complexity, there's also system complexity. So, how many moving pieces are there actually in your system?",
I was teaching a workshop at Pinterest. It was a five week workshop for engineers,
"on how to be more effective. And one of the stories I gathered from them was that back in 2011 when they were scaling their site,",
"they actually had six different data storage systems. They were running Cassandra, MySQL, Membase, Memcached,",
"MongoDB, and Redis. And they actually only had a team of three back end",
"engineers. That's insane. There were, like, two systems per engineer.",
Each system on paper set claims that they would solve some scalability problem that they were facing.,
"But in reality, each system just failed in its own special way. It was just another fire that they had to set out.",
"And so, when you make choices that really sort of fragment our infrastructure,",
that has a lot of ongoing taxes that we have to pay. It means that we're spending-- we're thus,
able to pull together resources to really strengthen libraries and abstractions for a particular system.,
It means we have to take time to understand the failure modes of each system that we introduce.,
It means that every new engineer who joins a team not to ramp up on one additional system.,
"And so, it took a while, but in the end, Pinterest finally learned that it's much simpler",
"to have a system, a scheme, where you can just add more machines to scale. And so, they cut out a lot of the other systems",
that it didn't really need and ended up with a much simpler system that they could actually maintain.,
"So, we've talked about code complexity and system complexity. Another such complexity is product complexity.",
"Now, that comes when there isn't a clear vision for where the product is going or there isn't enough product focus.",
Product complexity leads a lot to code complexity and simple complexity because it means you have to write more code and build more systems in order,
"to maintain and support the features that you're building. And when you have a wide surface area in your product,",
every new feature that you want to add becomes harder to add because you think about how does this fit in to the existing context of all,
the other features. There's more code branches you have to look over. There's more issues and bugs that are filed.,
There's more context switching that you have to deal with to go back and forth from feature to feature.,
"And all of the time that you spend doing this context switching is time that you're not investing in abstractions, [INAUDIBLE]",
"paying technical debt. And so, those are all things that end up slowing you down.",
"[INAUDIBLE] last soft of complexity, organizational complexity. Because when you have all of this complexity in your code",
"and your systems and your product, it means that you need a larger team to actually deal and manage with them all.",
"And that means you have to spend more time hiring and interviewing. You spend more time training, onboarding, mentoring",
"new engineers. And so, there's another tax on the organization as well. Now alternatively, some teams decide",
"OK, let's just split our team to smaller teams and each team sort of manage a separate component.",
Or maybe even have a one person team for each component. And there's cost for that as well.,
"It's less motivating to work on your own. If you get stuck, it can become more demotivating.",
The quality can go down because it's harder to get feedback from your coworkers if you don't the same shared context.,
"And your bus factor also goes down. I remember when I was working at Ooyala, there was one point in time where",
I was the only person who was knowledgeable about this piece of software called the logs processor.,
"So, the logs processor was responsible for processing all of our customer's data and then produce the reports",
that they could actually read and sort of understand what their viewers were doing. And I was taking a much needed vacation down in Hawaii.,
"I was hiking around one of the volcanoes there. And then, I suddenly get a text, and it's from the CTO.",
"And it says, logs processor is down. I said, well that sucks.",
"Unfortunately at that time, I was the only person who knew how to fix it.",
"And also unfortunately, there's no Wifi in volcanoes. And so, that wasn't a great situation.",
It was bad for me because my vacation was interrupted. It was bad for the team because they depended on me.,
And it was bad for our customers because they couldn't get the reports and the data that they needed,
"to operate their business. And so, there are all these costs of complexity",
"on these different levels. On the level of code, systems, product, organization. And they all come from this core thing",
"where we added more complexity than we needed. And so, that's why this theme of asking ourselves",
what's the simplest solution to this problem is so important. Because it allows us to stem off this complexity,
explosion at its bud at the very beginning.,
"And so, minimizing operational burden is super important. And the last high leverage activity I like to close on",
is actually building a great engineering culture. I mentioned earlier on how I've spent a lot of time,
on engineering hiring and recruiting. And one of the questions that I'll ask a lot of the candidates I interview,
"is, what's one thing you like and one thing you dislike about your previous company?",
"And over time, this really helped paint a picture of what exactly attracts an engineer to a company.",
"What are the things that turn them off? And it should actually come as no surprise that engineers, they like to work in environments where",
they can focus on high leverage activities. They want to work in environments where there's a chance to focus on and optimize on learning.,
"They want to work at places where everyone is very productive and getting a lot of things done, and there's good tooling and good iteration speed.",
They want to work at places where products aren't going to waste because assumptions and hypotheses weren't,
being tested earlier on. They want to work at places where they can actually build new features as opposed to just maintain and pay off,
"taxes for old existing ones. Now, Google is a sort of great place",
"in that there's a very strong sense of engineering culture. But this is also something that you can focus on your team,",
"as well. On a team level, you can really ask,",
what are the highest leverage activities that you can start working on?,
You can think about how can you invest in your own learning and in your own growth to really sort,
of further your own career? You can think about what tools can you build,
or what workflows can you improve for both yourself and for your team to really improve your iteration speed?,
Or think about a project that you're working on that's a multimonth project.,
Are there ways that you can break it down into testable hypotheses that you can validate to make sure,
"that you're actually building the right thing for customers, for users, or other members of the team?",
"Or think about if you're working on something that seems a little bit too complex, is there a way to actually make it simpler",
and pay off these future taxes on complexity?,
"Or think about, how can you improve the engineering culture in your own team so that new engineers who join the team",
can ramp up much more quickly? All of those high leverage activities,
will make us more effective engineers. I'll be happy to do some Q&A. Thank you all for coming.,
[APPLAUSE] I also a few limited copies of books,
that we're going to hand out. May be Cindy or [? Chang ?] can sort of hand them out as people ask questions.,
Unit tests. I kind of read in your book and it kind of presented unit tests as a high leverage kind of activity.,
"But at the same time, kind of like intuitively when I think about writing unit tests, I feel like it's kind of slow.",
"I got to write all these to cover all this code. And if I want to refactor it, I got to change this unit test.",
"So, iteration speed kind of slows down. Maybe you could talk a little bit about exactly why unity tests are really",
"high leverage in spite of that kind of feeling that I get?   Sure. Great question, [INAUDIBLE].",
"So the question is, how do you reason about unit tests",
"with this framework of leverage? And really, I think it's important to not be",
"religious about unit tests. I think there are some teams that focus on, OK, we need 100% coverage of our code.",
And I don't think that's necessarily the best approach. It's a lot better think about which types of tests,
"would be high leverage? Which types of tests would be easy to write, and yet pay off high rewards?",
And the area of code bases that tend to benefit from a lot more tests are,
"code paths that either see a lot of traffic, code paths that a lot of engineers touch,",
"or code paths that are a lot riskier. And so, if something were to go wrong, data would get corrupted",
"or the cost would be large. In each of those areas, it can be really beneficial to actually have a set of unit tests.",
"On the other hand, if you have a piece of code that's sort of off to the side, not many people use it,",
"it's not touched that often, in those cases, writing a unit test there might not have that strong a payoff.",
"And so, I would sort of break down unit tests into different priority buckets and sort of focus on the ones",
"where there is more traffic, people are changing it a lot more often, or it's a lot riskier.",
"Because those will have sort of a better rate of return on your time.    So, it seems to me you have a lot of experience",
with working with startups and small companies. And I wonder actually how does your advice translate to a bigger organization such as Google?,
"As you were talking through strategies, I was thinking in my head about a particular example that illustrates this strategy.",
"And for a big company, for example, for the recent problems, organizational complexity kind",
"of becomes unavoidable. So, it seems to me from your presentation,",
"you give advice for the more bottom up approach, which Google is a lot like. But for a big organization, actually",
"maybe some top down strategies are needed as well. For example, for using product complexity and organization",
"complexity. Do you have any thoughts on this?   Yeah. So the question, to rephrase a little bit,",
is how do these ideas of focusing on complex-- or addressing organizational complexity apply to larger,
companies like Google? And I think it's a great question.,
"I think some of the clarity comes from-- some of the strategies that an individual contributor,",
an individual engineer where you can sort of influence the complexity in large organizations comes I think a lot from data.,
"So, I know Google is a very data driven company. And a lot of times, if you can ask the right questions",
"and back that up with any data from users, data from activity, you can sort shift organizations or products in a way",
"to sort of streamline it. So, if you see a source of complexity from a feature",
"that you gather data and it seems like it's not actually being used, I think that sort of forms",
"a more compelling case for decision makers that, maybe this is an area of the product that isn't really",
"worth all the engineering effort that's being spent on it. And so, I think data is was definitely",
one area that can be used to amplify your voice when you are making arguments of that nature.,
I think another way that you can sort of reduce complexity in these situations is to talk to the decision,
makers and get clarity on what the focus and what the mission is. And make sure that the projects that you work on,
are ones that sort of align with that mission and that focus. Because if you're working on something that seems peripheral,
"to that mission or focus, then you're sort of introducing additional sources of complexity",
"to that mission, that focus, that the organization has. So, you want to at least make sure",
that your own work is aligned with the goals of the rest of the organization has.,
"So, I have two questions having to do with the transition between from engineer to engineer manager, so maybe they",
"are within the scope of the book. One is about mentoring, the other is about technical data. So, first would be, what are your thoughts on mentoring",
"in terms of leverage? And the second is, how do you recommend convincing an engineering manager",
that the code complexity in your project is worth taking a sprint break from delivering to actually,
refactoring something thing from scratch with a much simpler version?   Good question.,
"So the two questions. One is, is mentoring a leverage? Two is how does refactoring and paying off technical debts",
"[INAUDIBLE] into this? So with regards to the first one mentoring, mentoring is definitely I think extremely high leverage.",
I spent a year and a half when I was at Quora building out the onboarding and mentoring programs because I realize that even if an engineer would have spend,
"and one hour a day training a new hire, that only represents like 1%-- it's like 20 hours.",
That's like 1% of the new hire's total hours in that year.,
"And yet it can have a dramatic output, a dramatic impact on that engineer's output. And so, it's super valuable, I think,",
to invest money in training your teammates and making sure that you tell them and teach them,
what the best practices are before they spend a lot of time writing code that's not following the right guidelines,
"or following bad designs. And so, mentoring is super valuable. And the second question is, how do you convince engineering managers to actually focus",
on or to budget time for technical debt? And I think some of the best strategies I've seen for teams,
is to rather than just to have that conversation and spend all that energy convincing your engineering,
"manager after, like say, every project, to instead sort of just set a sort",
"of consistent budget for that. So some teams, for instance, every month",
"will have one week where it's code cleanup week. Or after every sprint, they'll have some number of days",
"where they spend refactoring and cleaning code. That way, it's-- you don't have to have this sort",
"of conversation every time after every project. And in addition, you can use that time and prioritize",
"which areas of the code actually need to be refactored. Which areas of code need to be cleaned up. And so, I think it's more useful to have",
"a more general conversation where to hit the goals for the sprints, we're going to make some trade offs.",
Those trade offs will lead to some debt. And we want to have a consistent schedule where,
"every so often, we budget some number of days to basically clean up that debt. Yeah, it's a little tricky if you're a new engineer.",
"I would say that even as a new engineer, the way that you should approach technical debt is to focus on the areas where reducing that debt",
"allows you to be more productive. So, if you're reducing debt on errors of the code that you have to deal with yourself,",
"a lot of times doing that making, that investment actually pays off on your own project because you can get your project done sooner.",
"That's sort of, I think, a very easy way to justify that time spent because you can provably",
"demonstrate that it actually accelerates your own project speed. And so, I would start there.",
Some of the advice mentioned tackling unknowns early in the project lifecycle and some,
"of the other advice was focusing on the simple things. I wonder, do you have any advice on how",
to identify unknowns that could be removed by focusing on simplicity versus unknowns that,
"deserve their own investment and investigation?   So, the question is, how do you",
differentiate between unknowns that need to be investigated and unknowns that you can potentially cut by focusing,
on a simpler solution?,
I don't have a simple answer for that but I think some of the approaches that you can take,
"is to think about what are your goals for this certain project? And if you didn't have to design a grand system, what",
would be the simplest solution that you could think of that could maybe hit most of those goals?,
"Because a lot of times, the complexity comes from trying to address the last 10% or the last 5%.",
"And if you would take a more pragmatic approach, maybe you can ask instead, what covers",
"80% percent of the use cases? Can I come up with a solution for that? And then maybe for the other cases,",
can we do something different rather than making the core solution more complicated?,
And I think that's something that-- that's a theme that I've definitely seen other teams do with success.,
"Because then for the most part, they're dealing with something that is simple to reason about.    So I have a question, a lot",
"of cases we have dependencies on other teams. For example, my team, sometimes I go,",
there's a problem in the [INAUDIBLE] Bluetooth stack. Then so I have to make a talk with them or either,
I'd have to look into the Bluetooth stack by myself. Which sometimes can be harder because I don't really,
have a lot of expertise on the low level code.,
"So, can you talk a little your experience about how do you deal with team dependencies?",
"How to talk and actually cooperate with other teams?   So the question is, how do you",
deal with interteam dependencies where you're sort of blocked on someone else?,
So a lot of times when you're blocked on someone else and they're not actually working on this thing,
"that you really care about, that happens because there's a misalignment in incentives. Somehow your team has a certain goal.",
"The other team has a certain goal. And those goals, maybe our priorities don't really align.",
"And so, I think structurally, a good approach",
is to try to make those goals align. To see if you can agree that a certain focus is,
a priority for both teams this quarter and sort of agree from that perspective.,
"If they don't align, I think at least having that conversation tells you then where-- the part that you're blocked on,",
"where that fits on their priority list. And so, at least having that conversation, you know that maybe this is only like a medium to low priority",
"for the other team. At that point, then you can make this decision of well, do I wait for them to work on that?",
Or do I then-- maybe I ramp up on that Bluetooth stack to actually make progress.,
"But I think it really sort of starts from that communication about goals and incentives. If they align, then you can sort of rely more on that team.",
"If they don't align, you do have to make that trade off of, maybe it's worth my time to learn this Bluetooth stack",
so that I can get the thing out the door sooner rather than waiting for them to get to it on the bottom of their priority list.,
"So, you mentioned the 60 to 80 hour work weeks not being sustainable.",
I was wondering what your typical work week is like? And if you ever work weekends anymore?,
And you also mention learning. I was wondering how much time per week do you set aside for learning. Is it an hour on the weekend that you spend,
or is it five minutes a day? How do you incorporate that into your daily routine?,
"So nowadays, I still work at a startup. I work at a startup called Quip. And we actually work very normal hours,",
so we work maybe 40 hour weeks. I do spend a lot of personal time on just sort of investing in things like the book,
or these talks or other ways I can teach engineers to be more effective.,
"Mainly because that's something I'm excited to do. In terms of how much time I invest in learning,",
"I personally love to read, so I end up just reading a lot of books. And I think books are a really large source and wealth",
of information for me. I don't know how much time I spend reading,
Transcriber: Soumya Satheesan Reviewer: Denise RQ,
"Thank you very much, everyone.",
"I stared civil engineering three years ago, here at Imperial,",
and it's been a hell of a ride.,
"It's really been very enriching,",
"because I have to trust that when I graduate in a year,",
if there's a graduate out there who'll be able design a bridge,
"that's going to work and not kill everyone that goes on it,",
it's going to be me and the people who graduate with me.,
And that's a really exciting prospect.,
It's also a little bit daunting.,
The great thing about being here and learning these things,
is that it's a fantastic learning curve.,
It's something that I truly believe in.,
When I came into the lecture theater I've spent most of my life in -,
"you probably will have one, lecture theater 201 -",
I was powered by that very prospect: the prospect that everyday,
"I was going to be adding on to this four-year learning curve,",
and I was going to be getting all this great new knowledge.,
I got so interested in keeping up with this process,
that I didn't have time to look back.,
"Recently I thought, ""Let's look back at what's happened every few years",
and see how I've grown along,
"this really long engineering learning curve.""",
"The reality is that it's been a lot harder for me than I thought it would be,",
"because when I left home,",
"I put all of my stuff in the back of my parents' car,",
and I drove to university.,
"But when I got here,",
"there have been instances where I felt genuinely out of place,",
"genuinely unhappy, which was really surprising to me",
because engineering was what I felt I was made for.,
I decided to try and understand why I was feeling this.,
"I, as you heard, am Franco-Australian",
and I went to an international school in the suburbs of Paris.,
I was being taught in French and English all the time.,
"I was surrounded by people who were just like me,",
who were interested in lots of different things,
and were studying lots of different topics.,
We were all jumping from different topics that we were interested in,
"not because we had short attention spans or we all had ADHD or something,",
but because we had a genuine interest in a wide variety of topics.,
We were encouraged to pursue them.,
I fitted right into that environment. I found that that was home.,
"When I left high school and I came to university,",
I brought that model along with me.,
And so when I got here - you probably all know freshers fair -,
as a first year I was really excited.,
I signed up for as many things as I could.,
I was getting emails left and right. I joined lots of different clubs.,
And I was really busy first year. I was having a whale of a time.,
"I was meeting lots of great people,",
"but through these societies, so I had common interests with them.",
I thought I was meeting them because we were all doing many different things.,
It turned out it took me eight months to realize,
that not only was nobody else that I knew doing this,
but a lot of people in my year thought that I was a bit of a freak.,
(Laughter).,
I even heard a guy tell me,
"that I was this weird guy that wasn't in the right course,",
"that he wasn't supposed to be an engineer, but he was sticking around",
probably because his parents were pushing him to get a degree.,
"So as long as he was going to be here for four years,",
he might as well focus on doing other things than work when he could.,
"That really resonated with me, because I was like, ""Hang on, why?""",
"I tried talking to them and advocating for and cultivating these other interests,",
and I just kept hitting a wall.,
It's not that they were boring people.,
"It's just they wanted to do their work,",
"and they were open to doing one sport activity and maybe another club,",
as long as it wasn't too much of a hassle,
"not too much involvement, not too much work.",
"But I thought that my Model United Nations debating platform was as important,",
which is something I'm still active in as my finite element analysis lecture.,
I was the only one to think that.,
It started getting to me,
"that maybe I'm a little bit wrong, and maybe they are right.",
"Maybe the role of an engineer is not necessarily this open,",
because we do have a great responsibility.,
"When you think about it,",
"when a surgeon makes a mistake, he kills the patient that's in front.",
"When an engineer makes a mistake, he can kill a lot of people in one go.",
"There is that responsibility, so maybe we should focus",
"on making sure we have a technical base, and we never get it wrong.",
"I started hitting a bit of a low point,",
"and wondering what I had lived so far, and what I was living here.",
It was a little bit of a rock bottom; the sky was a little bit cloudy.,
But you know how life is.,
Life has a way of throwing things at you from time to time.,
I got a phone call from my dad who had just heard about this summit.,
It was taking place in Pittsburgh in the US. It was called the One Young World.,
"There were lots of really interesting great leaders,",
"from this current generation, great thinkers,",
"great speakers who were going to talk to [1,300] young people.",
These young people were selected for the work they do all around the world.,
"We were going to bring them together over a platform of six different topics,",
"with debating and sharing,",
and that's how you would get the new generation to start doing things.,
"I was like, ""Yup, this is for me; this is right up my alley.""",
"I took a week off of lectures first year, which is a big thing to do,",
and I went to this summit.,
"Actually, it's the beginning of second year now.",
I'm giving my thinking one last chance.,
I had an incredible time.,
"I met 1,300 of the most creative,",
"most hard working, most innovative people you've ever met.",
"Also, there were lots of great speakers.",
"We had President Clinton come and give the opening address,",
and no one told me that Clinton was coming.,
"So I just sat in the opening ceremony, and they say at some point,",
"""Please welcome Mr. Clinton.""",
"I'm like, ""Oh, that's funny! I know of a president called Clinton.""",
"Then I look up, and the actual guy came up on stage.",
"At that point, I just kept smiling for half an hour.",
My facial expression didn't change at all. And it was just him speaking.,
"We were all really encouraged and inspired for the entire four days of the debate,",
"because these were people who saw the world in a way that I saw it,",
"who believed in this Model UN coming together,",
"anyone from any background, and sharing no matter what your experience is,",
and coming up with one resolution.,
"I came back from this summit fully engaged,",
and what I realized afterwards,
was that I didn't meet a single other engineer there -,
not one.,
I went back to my lecture theater,
"with all my peers who thought I was a little bit weird,",
"convinced that I belonged in that lecture theater,",
because I came back with the belief that you're an engineer,
not because you have a grade that says you have the right percentage;,
"you're one because you're passionate about people and the environment,",
and about bringing those together in a sustainable and durable way.,
We need to think about engineering like this a little bit more.,
We need to make two changes to the way we think and incorporate engineers.,
"The first one is society needs to welcome them a little bit more,",
"because if you think about it, being an engineer is hard.",
There's also the reality that engineers are not putting themselves out there much.,
They're not that passionate about that.,
The reasoning behind it is the engineer is focused on the technical background.,
"When you think about it, a lot of society thinks of engineering as a bubble.",
"If you ever had to work with an engineer,",
"you talk to them when you want them to build something, fix something.",
"Then he comes in, he designs something, he builds it,",
and then he moves on to the next project.,
There isn't much sharing there.,
We have a vision of engineering,
as this one big silo that's completely isolated.,
The engineering professionals are not very good at communication.,
"They're not used to going out there and talking about their ideas,",
because they don't feel that's their role.,
We need the professionals to change that.,
We need to stop thinking about all these silos.,
"There isn't one engineer silo,",
"and then a marketing silo, and then an economic silo.",
There is just society,
with more need for people talking with one another.,
That's the big thing I want to let you all with today:,
we need to get rid of these silos.,
The great news is that I can attest for the fact that change is starting.,
"The first time that I came back from One Young World,",
I went to see my department,
and convinced them to send me back a second time as an official delegate -,
"nice, big, fancy title -",
and I went there and I started seeing in Johannesburg -,
which is where the summit was held -,
"that there is more people from technical backgrounds coming,",
"and even engineering companies, who were sending delegates over.",
"The fact that my department would be willing now,",
"after I've come back from the summit, to send an entire delegation next year,",
is a sign that they've realized this is the change that's happening.,
And they want to incorporate it.,
The fact that they're doing so and supporting me in the process,
is something I'm really grateful for.,
The reality is these engineers are not used or open to this idea.,
"When you come back, and you think about all these silos, it's limiting.",
"What we need to do, us as engineers,",
"is to be more open, more approachable, more willing,",
"more responsible for ideas, take responsibilities,",
because it's not just the fact of coming up with the idea.,
"It's also the fact of making sure that it's promoted properly,",
"that it gets out into the world,",
"that knowledge can reach as many people as possible,",
"because the greatest idea in an engineer's mind,",
you can have the smartest guy,
"who's just in a room, having his idea, and working on it,",
"but if he's all alone in that room, and he's not changing anything,",
he's just a lonely guy in an empty room.,
There's no way that information is getting anywhere.,
"And so far, engineers have relied on other people to do that work for them.",
But we need to change that dynamic a little bit.,
There's also the reality that society needs to accept them more.,
"If there's something you are going to do when you leave today,",
"try and include an engineer in something you have never included one in before,",
because they have incredible input.,
They're very creative people. They're very open.,
They're just in their world. They're still in their bubble.,
And we need to burst that bubble open.,
The mentality that we all work in these different silos,
"is an old mentality, but it's taking its sweet time to die off.",
And we need to help it take the final breath.,
Another piece of good news,
"is the fact that companies are also starting to realize this change,",
because more and more people are graduating with degrees out there.,
It used to be that you could tell them apart just based on academic ability.,
And that's still the belief in most institutions.,
"But companies have all these positions open, and they can't fill them anymore,",
because the graduates want recognition as well.,
So companies are starting to look in profile a little bit more.,
"All of a sudden, that little society I was doing on the side, extra,",
goes from being a complete waste of study time,
"to something that sets you apart from the rest of the people,",
and that gives you a really valuable profile.,
"One of the other things we need to include,",
"while we're talking about education of engineers,",
"is this idea that we need to change the way we train them as well,",
"because, when you think about it, who according to a university -",
I'm sure you can all relate to this -,
who ticks all the boxes?,
Who's the best guy?,
"The guy who gets 100%, right?",
"The guy who's always there on time, always giving coursework,",
and always gets an A.,
"I like to call these people professors in the making,",
because that's what they are going to end up becoming.,
But universities need to update their system a little bit,
to make sure that we take into account practical implementation skills,
"when we assess students,",
"because having, again, these greatest ideas,",
"if you just keep them to yourself, they won't be applied.",
"These changes, I feel are necessary.",
The great thing is that engineers are open to them.,
A lot of people have said of engineering is the most essential profession.,
It's the one profession that sustains civilization.,
Why then should we keep on accepting it living all on its own?,
Let's come together and break down those silos.,
Thank you very much.,
"When I think about the rise of AI,",
I'm reminded by the rise of literacy.,
"A few hundred years ago,",
many people in society thought,
that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write.,
"Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep,",
so maybe there was less need for written communication.,
And all that was needed,
was for the high priests and priestesses and monks,
"to be able to read the Holy Book,",
and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church,
or the holy building,
and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us.,
"Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society",
if lots of people can read and write.,
"Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses.",
"These are the highly skilled AI engineers,",
many of whom work in the big tech companies.,
And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them.,
I think that we can build a much richer society,
if we can enable everyone to help to write the future.,
But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies?,
Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build.,
"They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers,",
and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars,
to build an AI system.,
"And the large tech companies,",
particularly the ones with hundreds of millions,
"or even billions of users,",
have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off,
"because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system,",
such as one that improves web search,
"or that recommends better products for online shopping,",
can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users,
to generate a massive amount of revenue.,
But this recipe for AI does not work,
once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places,
"where, for the most part,",
there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people,
or that generate comparable economics.,
Let me illustrate an example.,
"Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store",
to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza,
from the gentleman that owns this pizza store.,
"And his pizza is great,",
"but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around,",
and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock.,
"But when I watch him operate his store,",
"I get excited,",
"because by selling pizza,",
he is generating data.,
And this is data that he can take advantage of,
if he had access to AI.,
"AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data,",
and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well,
"on a Friday night,",
maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon.,
"Now you might say to me, ""Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store.",
"What's the big deal?""",
"And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store,",
something that could help him improve his revenues,
"by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him.",
"I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets,",
and having more data does help.,
"But contrary to the hype,",
AI can often work just fine,
"even on modest amounts of data,",
such as the data generated by a single pizza store.,
So the real problem is not,
that there isn't enough data from the pizza store.,
The real problem is that the small pizza store,
could never serve enough customers,
to justify the cost of hiring an AI team.,
I know that in the United States,
there are about half a million independent restaurants.,
"And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers.",
"But every restaurant is different with a different menu,",
"different customers, different ways of recording sales",
that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them.,
What would it be like if we could enable small businesses,
and especially local businesses to use AI?,
Let's take a look at what it might look like,
at a company that makes and sells T-shirts.,
I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company,
can use AI for demand forecasting.,
"Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts",
"that would drive sales,",
by looking at what's trending on social media.,
"Or for product placement,",
why can't a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like,
and show it to an AI,
and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales?,
Supply chain.,
Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars,
"per yard for a piece of fabric now,",
or if they should keep looking,
because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere?,
Or quality control.,
A quality inspector should be able to use AI,
to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts,
to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth.,
"Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these",
and to great effect.,
But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic,
or retailer or school or local farm,
will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today.,
Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker,
that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them.,
"And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors",
"in other industries, even large companies",
"such as the pharmaceutical companies,",
"the car makers, the hospitals,",
also struggle with this.,
This is the long-tail problem of AI.,
If you were to take all current and potential AI projects,
"and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them,",
you get a graph that looks like this.,
Maybe the single most valuable AI system,
is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet.,
"Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine,",
maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system.,
"But when you go to the right of this curve,",
you then get projects like T-shirt product placement,
or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting.,
And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built.,
"Even T-shirt demand forecasting,",
"if it depends on trending memes on social media,",
"is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting,",
if that depends on the pizzeria sales data.,
So today there are millions of projects,
"sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on,",
but whose aggregate value is massive.,
So how can we enable small businesses and individuals,
to build AI systems that matter to them?,
"For most of the last few decades,",
"if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do.",
You have to write pages and pages of code.,
"And while I would love for everyone to learn to code,",
"and in fact, online education and also offline education",
"are helping more people than ever learn to code,",
"unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this.",
But there is an emerging new way,
to build AI systems that will let more people participate.,
"Just as pen and paper,",
"which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel,",
"were instrumental to widespread literacy,",
there are emerging new AI development platforms,
that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code,
to asking you to focus on providing data.,
And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do.,
"Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these.",
Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building.,
Take the example of an inspector,
wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric.,
An inspector can take pictures of the fabric,
"and upload it to a platform like this,",
and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like,
by drawing rectangles.,
And they can also go in to show the AI,
what discoloration on the fabric looks like,
by drawing rectangles.,
"So these pictures,",
together with the green and pink rectangles,
"that the inspector's drawn,",
are data created by the inspector,
to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration.,
"After the AI examines this data,",
"we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears,",
but not yet enough pictures of discolorations.,
"This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears,",
but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations.,
So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations,
"to show to the AI,",
to help it deepen this understanding.,
"By adjusting the data you give to the AI,",
you can help the AI get smarter.,
So an inspector using an accessible platform like this,
"can, in a few hours to a few days,",
"and with purchasing a suitable camera set up,",
"be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects,",
tears and discolorations in all the fabric,
being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory.,
"And once again, you may say,",
"""Hey, Andrew, this is one factory.",
"Why is this a big deal?""",
"And I say to you,",
this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier,
"and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI",
"to check for the quality of the cakes they're making,",
"or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables,",
or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using.,
Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years,
before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner.,
"But many of these platforms are coming along,",
and some of them are getting to be quite useful,
"to someone that is tech savvy today,",
with just a bit of training.,
"But what this means is that,",
rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses,
"to write AI systems for everyone else,",
"we can start to empower every accountant,",
"every store manager,",
every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems.,
I hope that the pizzeria owner,
and many other small business owners like him,
will also take advantage of this technology,
because AI is creating tremendous wealth,
and will continue to create tremendous wealth.,
And it's only by democratizing access to AI,
that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society.,
Hundreds of years ago.,
I think hardly anyone understood the impact,
that widespread literacy will have.,
"Today, I think hardly anyone understands",
the impact that democratizing access to AI will have.,
"Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people,",
but that does not have to be the case.,
"In the coming era for AI,",
"we'll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves,",
and I think that will be incredibly exciting future.,
Thank you very much.,
hello so in just a few minutes um elon musk will,
be joining us here live on stage for a conversation uh,
rumor has it there are a few things to talk about with him um,
we we we will see but um before that i just want to show you something,
special i want you to come with me to tesla's huge gigafactory in austin texas,
so the day before it opened last week the evening before i was allowed to walk around it,
no one else there and what i saw there was honestly pretty mind-blowing,
this is elon musk's famous machine that builds the machine and his view the,
secret to a sustainable future is not just making an electric car it's making a system that churns out,
huge numbers of electric cars with a margin so that they can fund further,
growth when i was there um none of us knew whether elon would actually be able to make it here today so i took the chance,
to sit down with him and record an epic interview and i just want to show you,
a nine an eight minute excerpt of that interview so here from austin texas elon,
musk i want us to switch now to think a bit about artificial intelligence i i'm curious about your timelines and how you,
predict and how come some things are so amazingly on the money and some aren't so when it comes to predicting,
sales of tesla vehicles for example i mean you've kind of been amazing i think in 2014,
when tesla had sold that year 60 000 cars you said 2020 i think we will do,
half a million a year yeah we did almost exactly half a million five years ago last time you came today we um i asked,
you about for self-driving and um you said yep this very year where i am,
confident that we will have a car going from la to new york uh without any,
intervention yeah i i don't want to blow your mind but i'm not always right um,
so talk what's the difference between those two why why why has full self-driving in particular,
been so hard to predict i mean the thing that really got me and i think it's going to get a lot of other people is,
that there are just so many false stones with with self-driving um where you think you,
think you've got the problem have a handle on the problem and then it nope uh it turns out uh you just hit a,
ceiling um and and uh uh because what happened if you if you were,
to plot the progress the progress looks like a log curve so it's like yeah a series of log curves so,
uh most people don't like cookies i suppose but it shows the show it goes it goes up sort of a you know,
sort of a fairly straight way and then it starts tailing off right and and and you start there's a kind of ocean getting diminishing returns you know in,
retrospect they seem obvious but uh in in order to solve uh full self-driving uh properly you actually just you have,
to solve real-world ai um you you you know because you said what are the road networks designed to,
to work with they're designed to work with a biological neural net our brains and with uh vision our eyes,
and so in order to make it work with computers you basically need,
to solve real world ai and vision because because we we need,
we need cameras and silicon neural nets uh in order to have to have,
self-driving work for a system that was designed for eyes and biological neural nets,
it you know when you i guess when you put it that way it's like quite obvious that the only way to solve full,
self-driving is to solve real-world ai and sophisticated vision what do you,
feel about the current architecture do you think you have an architecture now where where there is,
a chance for the logarithmic curve not to tail off any anytime soon,
well i mean admittedly these these uh may be an infamous uh last words but i i actually,
am confident that we will solve it this year uh that we will exceed uh you're like what the probability,
of an accident at what point should you exceed that of the average person right um i think we will exceed that this year,
we could be here talking again in a year it's like well yeah another year went by and it didn't happen but i think this i think this is,
the year is there an element that you actually deliberately make aggressive prediction timelines to,
drive people to be ambitious and without that nothing gets done so it's it feels like at some point in,
the last year seeing the progress on understanding you that you're that the,
ai the tesla ai understanding the world around it led to a kind of an aha moment,
in tesla because you really surprised people recently when you said probably the most important product,
development going on at tesla this year is this robot optimus yes,
is it something that happened in the development of fourself driving that gave you the confidence to say you know what we could do something special here,
yeah exactly so you know it took me a while to sort of realize that that in order to solve self-driving you really,
needed to solve real-world ai um at the point of which you solve real-world ai for a car which is really,
a robot on four wheels uh you can then generalize that to a robot on legs as,
well the thing that the things that are currently missing are uh enough intelligence enough to tell,
intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world and do useful things without being explicitly instructed it,
is so so the missing things are basically real world uh intelligence and uh scaling up manufacturing um those are,
two things that tesla is very good at and uh so then we basically just need to,
design the the uh specialized actuators and sensors that are needed for a humanoid robot,
people have no idea this is going to be bigger than the car um but so talk about i mean i think the,
first applications you you've mentioned are probably going to be manufacturing but eventually the vision is to to have,
these available for people at home correct if you had a robot that really,
understood the 3d architecture of your house and knew where every object in that house,
was or was supposed to be and could recognize all those objects i mean that,
that's kind of amazing isn't that like like that the kind of thing that you could ask a robot to do would be what like tidy up yeah um,
absolutely or make make dinner i guess mow the lawn take take a cup of tea to grandma and,
show her family pictures and exactly take care of my grandmother and,
make sure yeah exactly and it could recognize obviously recognize everyone in the home yeah could play catch with,
your kids yes i mean obviously we need to be careful this doesn't uh become a dystopian situation,
um like i think one of the things that's going to be important is to have a localized rom chip on the,
robot that cannot be updated over the air uh where if you for example were to,
say stop stop stop that would if anyone said that then the robot would stop you know type of thing,
and that's not updatable remotely um i think it's going to be important to have safety features like that,
yeah that that sounds wise and i do think there should be a regular free agency for ai i've said this for many,
years i don't love being regulated but i you know i think this is an important thing for public safety do you think,
there will be basically like in say 2050 or whatever that like a a robot in most homes is what they will,
be and people will probably count you'll have your own butler basically,
yeah you'll have your sort of buddy robot probably yeah i mean how much of a buddy,
do like do you do how many applications you thought is there you know can you have a romantic partner,
lot of a sex inevitable i mean i did promise the internet that i would make cat girls we'll have we could,
make a robot cackle how are you because yeah you know,
so yeah i i guess uh it'll be what whatever people want really you know so what sort,
of timeline should we be thinking about of the first the first models that are actually made and,
sold you know the the first units that that we tend to make are,
um for jobs that are dangerous boring repetitive and things that people don't want to do and you know i think we'll,
have like an interesting prototype uh sometime this year we might have something useful next year but i think,
quite likely within at least two years and then we'll see rapid growth year over year of the usefulness of the,
humanoid robots um and decrease in cost and scaling out production help me on the economics of this so what,
what do you picture the cost of one of these being well i think the cost is actually not going to be uh crazy high,
um like less than a car yeah but but think about the economics of this if you can,
replace a thirty thousand dollar forty thousand dollar a year worker,
which you have to pay every year with a one-time payment of twenty five thousand dollars for a robot that can,
work longer hours doesn't go on vacation i mean that could it could be a pretty rapid replacement,
of certain types of jobs how worried should the world be about that i wouldn't worry about the the sort of,
putting people out of a job thing um i think we're actually going to have and already do have a massive shortage of labor so i,
i i think we'll we will have um uh,
not not people out of work but actually still a shortage labor even in the future uh but,
this really will be a world of abundance any goods and services uh will be available to anyone who wants,
them that it'll be so cheap to have goods and services it'll be ridiculous,
so that is part of an epic 80 minute interview,
which we are releasing to people members of ted 2022 right after this,
conference um you should be able to look at it on the ted live,
website um there's public interest in it we're putting that out to the world on sunday,
afternoon i think sunday evening but uh but if you're into this kind of stuff um definitely a good thing to do over the,
weekend um now then hearing from elon live there's there's huge public interest in that we have,
opened up this segment to live stream and so we're joined right now by i think quite,
a few people around the world um welcome to vancouver welcome to ted 22 you're joining us on the last day of our,
conference here in a packed theater and,
we've been hearing all week from people with dreams about what the next era,
of humanity is going to be and now arguably the biggest visionary of them all elon,
musk [Music],
hey elon welcome,
so elon um a few hours ago you made an offer to buy twitter,
why [Laughter],
how'd you know little bird tweeted in my ear or something i don't,
know by the way have you seen the movie ted about the bear i i i have i have a movie,
so um yeah yeah so was there a question,
why why make that offer oh so um well i think it's very important for,
uh there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,
where all yeah so uh yeah um,
twitter has become kind of the de facto town square um so,
uh it's just really important that people have the both the uh the reality and the,
perception uh that they're able to speak freely within the bounds of the law um,
and you know so one of the things that i believe twitter should do is open source,
the algorithm um and make any changes uh to people's tweets you know if,
they're emphasized or de-emphasized uh that action should be made apparent so you anyone can see that,
action has been taken so there's there's no sort of behind the scenes manipulation either algorithmically or,
manually um but last week when we spoke elon um i asked,
you whether you were thinking of taking over you said no way said i i do not want to own twitter it is a recipe for,
misery everyone will blame me for everything what on earth changed no i think i think everyone will still blame,
me for everything yeah if something if if i acquire twitter and something goes wrong it's my,
fault 100 i i think there will be quite a few arrows uh yes um it will it will be,
miserable but you still want to do it why i mean i hope it's not too miserable uh but,
um i i just think it's important to the fun like,
uh it's important to the function of democracy,
it's important to the function of uh the united states uh as a free,
country and many other countries and to help actually to help freedom in the world more broadly than the u.s,
and so i think it's uh it's a,
you know i think this there's the risk civilizational risk uh is decreased if twitter,
the more we can increase the trust of twitter as a public platform and so,
i do think this will be somewhat painful and i'm not sure that i will actually be able to to acquire it,
and i should also say the intent is is to retain as many shareholders as is,
allowed by the law in a private company which i think is around 2000 or so so we'll it's not like it,
it's definitely not not from the standpoint of letting me figure out how to monopolize or maximize my ownership of twitter,
but we'll try to bring along as many shoulders as we right as we're allowed to you don't necessarily want to pay out,
40 or whatever it is billion dollars in cash you you'd like them to come come with you in in,
i mean i mean i could technically afford it um,
what i'm saying is this this is this is uh this is not a way to sort of make money,
you know i think this is it's just that i think this is um this could,
my strong intuitive sense is that uh having a public platform that is maximally,
trusted um and and and and broadly inclusive,
um is extremely important to the future of civilization but you've described,
yourself i don't care about the economics at all okay that's that's core to hear you this is not about the economics it's for the,
the moral good that you think will achieve you you've described yourself elon as a free speech absolutist,
but does that mean that there's literally nothing that people can't say and it's okay,
well i i i think uh obviously uh twitter or any forum is,
bound by the laws of the country that it operates in um so,
obviously there are some limitations on free speech uh in in the us and and of,
course uh twitter would have to abide by those uh right rules so so so you can't incite,
people to violence like that that the like a direct incitement to violence you,
know you can't do the equivalent of crying fire in a in a movie theater for example no that would be a crime yeah,
right it should be a crime but here's here's the challenge is is that it's it's such,
a nuanced difference between different things so there's there's excitement to violence yeah,
that's a no if it's illegal um there's hate speech which some forms of hate speech are fine you know i hate spinach,
um i mean if it's a sauteed in a you know cream sauce that would be quite,
nice but so so but the problem is so so so let's say someone says okay here's one tweet i,
hate politician x yeah next tweet is i wish polite politician x wasn't alive,
as we some of us have said about putin right now for example so that's legitimate speech,
another tweet is i wish politician x wasn't alive with a picture of their head with a gun sight over it,
or that plus their address i mean at some point,
someone has to make a decision as to which of those is not okay can an algorithm,
do that well surely you need human judgment at some point no i think the like i said,
in my view uh twitter should um match the laws of the of the country of,
and and and really you know that there's an obligation to to do that um,
but going beyond going beyond that um and having it be unclear who's making what changes to who,
to where uh having tweets sort of mysteriously be promoted and demoted,
with no insight into what's going on uh having a black box algorithm uh promote some things and other not not other,
things i think this can be quite dangerous so so so the idea of opening the,
algorithm is a huge deal and i think many people would would welcome that of understanding exactly how it's making,
the decision and critique it and critique like i want to improve what wondering is like like i think like the,
code should be on github you know so then uh and so people can look through it and say like i see a problem here i,
don't i don't agree with this um they can highlight issues right um suggest changes in the same way that you,
sort of update linux or or signal or something like that you know but as i understand it like at some point right,
now what the algorithm would do is it would look at for example how many people have flagged a tweet as obnoxious,
and then at some point a human has to look at it and make make a decision as to does this,
cross the line or not that the algorithm itself can't i don't think yet um tell,
the difference between legal and okay and and definitely obnoxious and so the question is which,
humans you know make make that core i mean do you have do you have a picture of that right now twitter,
and facebook and others you know they've hired thousands of people to try to help make wise decisions and the trouble is,
that no one can agree on on what is wise how do you solve that,
well i i i think we would want to er on this if if in doubt uh,
let let the speech that let it exist uh it would have you know if it's a,
you know a a gray area i would say let let the tweet exist,
um but obviously you know in a case where there's perhaps a lot of controversy uh,
that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet if uh you know so the,
i'm not i'm not saying this is that i have all the answers here um but i i do think that we want to be just,
very reluctant to delete things and and have um just just be very cautious with with,
with permanent bands uh you know timeouts i think are better or uh than,
sort of permanent bands and um but just just in general like i said,
uh how how it won't be perfect but i think we wanted to really uh have,
like so the possession and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible,
and a good sign as to whether there's free speech is is,
is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like,
and if that is the case then we have free speech and it's it's damn annoying when someone you don't like says,
something you don't like that is a sign of a healthy functioning uh,
free speech situation so,
i think many people would agree with that and look at the reaction online many people are excited by you coming in and the changes you're,
proposing some others are absolutely horrified here's how they would see it they would say wait a sec we agree that,
that twitter is an incredibly important town square it is a it is you know where the world exchanges opinion about life,
and death matters how on earth could it be owned by the world's richest person that can't be,
right so how how do you i mean what's the response there is there any way that you,
can distance yourself from the actual decision-making that matters on content,
at in some very clear way that is convincing to people,
well like i said i think the it's it's very important that like the,
the algorithm be open sourced and that any manual uh adjustments be uh identified like so if this tweet if,
somebody did something to a tweet it's there's information attached to it that this that action was taken and i i i i,
won't personally be uh you know in their editing tweets um,
but you'll know if something was done to promote demote or otherwise affect uh a,
tweet um you know as for media sort of ownership i mean you've,
got you know um mark zuckerberg owning facebook and instagram and whatsapp um,
and with a share ownership structure that will have mark zuckerberg the 14th still,
controlling those uh entities so,
literally um what's that need we won't have that on twitter,
if if you commit to opening up the algorithm that that definitely gives some level of confidence um talk about,
talk about some of the other changes that you've proposed so you at the edit button that's that's,
definitely coming if you if you have your way yeah yeah and how do you i mean i i think,
i mean one frankly um,
the top priority i have i would have is is eliminating the the spammings and scam,
bots and the bot armies that are on twitter um,
you know i think i think these these fun influence that they're not they're they're they they,
make the product much worse um if i see if you know if i had a dogecoin for every crypto,
scam i saw [Laughter],
more you know 100 billion dollars do you regret sparking the sort of storm,
of excitement overdose and you know where it's gone or i mean i think deutsche is fun and you,
know i've always said don't bet the form of dogecoin uh fyi yeah,
but i i think i think it's it's i like dogs and i like memes and uh it's got,
both of those and but just on the on the edit button how how do you get around the problem of so,
someone tweets elon rocks and it's tweeted by two million people um and um,
and then then after that they edit it so i'm elon sucks and um and then all those,
retweets they're all embarrassed and how how do you avoid that type of,
changing of meaning so that retweeters are exploited,
well i think uh you know you'd only have the edit capability for a short period,
of time and probably the thing to do at upon the edit would be to zero out,
all retweets and favorites okay i'm open to ideas though you know,
so in one way the um algorithm works kind of well for you right now i just i wanted to show you this this is so,
this is a typical tweet of of mine kind of lame and wordy and whatever and look,
at and the amazing response it gets is this oh my god 97 likes,
um and then i tried another one um and uh,
29 000 likes so the algorithm at least seems to be at the moment you know if,
elon musk expanded the world immediately um not bad right,
yeah i guess so i mean that was cool i mean you but but you've,
so help us understand how it is you've built this incredible um following on twitter yourself when,
i mean some of the people who love you the most look at some of what you tweet and they they they think it's somewhere between um,
embarrassing and crazy some of it's amazing i mean [Laughter],
is that actually why it's worked or why why has it worked i mean i don't know i mean i i'm,
you know tweeting more or less stream of consciousness you know it's not like let me think about some grand plan about my,
twitter or whatever you know i'm like literally on the toilet or something i'm like oh this is funny and then tweet,
that out you know that's that's like most of them [Laughter],
you know over sharing but um but you are obsessed with getting the most out of every minute of your day,
and so why not you know um so i don't know i just like try to tweet,
out like things that are interesting or funny or you know and then people seem to,
like it so if if you are unsuccessful actually before i ask that let me ask this if i,
don't yeah so how can i say is uh funding secured,
[Music] i i have sufficient uh assets to,
complete the uh it's not a forward-looking statement blah blah but,
i have to i mean i can do it if possible right um so um,
and um i mean i should say actually even in the in originally,
the uh with with tesla back in the day funding was actually secured,
i want to be clear about that um in fact this may be a good opportunity to to to clarify that um,
if funding was indeed secured um and uh i should say like why why do i do not,
have respect for the sec in that situation and i don't mean to blame everyone at the sec but certainly,
the san francisco office um it's because the sec knew that funding was secured,
but they pursued the an active public investigation nonetheless at the time tesla was in a,
precarious financial situation and i was told by the banks that if i did not agree to settle with the sec,
that they would the banks would cease providing working capital and tesla would go bankrupt immediately so that's like having,
a gun to your child's head so i was forced to concede to the sec,
unlawfully those bastards and and and now that they they say,
it makes it look like i lied when i did not in fact lie i was i was forced to admit that i lied for to save tesla's,
life and that's the only reason given what's actually happened,
given what's actually happened to tesla since then though aren't you glad that you didn't take it private,
yeah i mean it's difficult to put yourself in the position at the time tesla was under the,
most relentless short seller attack in the history of the stock market uh there's something called short and,
distort um where the barrage of negativity that tesla was experiencing from short sales,
wall street was beyond or belief tesla was the most shorted stock in the history of stock markets,
this is saying something so you know this was affecting our ability to hire people it was affecting our,
ability to sell cars it was uh they were yeah it was terrible um,
yeah they wanted tesla to die so bad they could taste it well most of them have paid the price,
yes where are they now um,
so so that was a really strong statement i mean obviously a lot of people who who support you i thought would say,
you have so much to offer the world on the upside on the vision side don't don't waste your time,
getting getting distracted by these these battles that bring out negativity and and and make people feel that you're,
being defensive or like people don't like fights especially with with powerful government authorities they'd rather they'd rather buy into your to a,
dream do do you like aren't you encouraged by people just just to edit that,
in that you know temptation out and uh go with the bigger story,
um well i mean i i would say like you know i'm sort of a mixed bag you know i,
mean well you're a fighter and you you don't you don't you don't you don't,
you don't like to lose and and you you you are determined that you don't basically i i mean you are sure i don't,
like to lose i'm not sure many people do um but the truth matters to me a lot really,
like sort of pathologically it matters to me okay so so you don't like to lose if in,
this case you are not successful in you know the board does not accept your offer you've said,
you won't go higher is there a plan b,
there is i i think we i think we would like to,
hear a little bit about plan b,
for it for another time i think another time yeah all right [Applause],
i that that's a nice tease all right so um,
i i would love to try to understand this brain of yours,
more ilan i i if with your permission i'd like to just play this this is the oh actually before we do that,
um here was one of the of the thousands of questions that people asked i thought this was actually quite a good one um if,
you could go back in time and change one decision you made along the way do your own edit button,
which one would it be and why do you mean like a career decision or something,
just any decision over the last few years like your decision to invest in twitter in the first place or your,
anything um i mean the the worst business decision i ever made,
was um not starting tesla with just jb straval,
by far the worst decision i've ever made is not just starting tesla with jb,
that that that's the number one by far all right so jb strabo was was the visionary co-founder who who who was,
obsessed with and knew so much about batteries and your your decision to go with tesla the company as it was meant,
that you got locked into what you concluded it was a weird architecture now this this,
there's a lot of confusion tesla tesla did not exist in any,
tesla was a shell company with no employees uh no intellectual property when i invested but the,
a false narrative has been created by um one of the other co-founders uh martin everhard and i don't want to get into,
the nastiness here but uh i didn't invest in an existing company,
we created a company yeah and ultimately the creation that company uh,
was was done by uh jv and me um and unfortunately there's a someone else and,
another co-founder who has made it his life's mission uh to make it sound like he he created,
the company which is false wasn't there another issue right at the heart of the development of,
the tesla model 3 where tesla almost went bankrupt and i i think you have said that part of the reason for that,
was that you overestimated the extent to which it was possible at that time to,
automate a a factory a huge amount was spent kind of over automating and it didn't,
work and it nearly took the company down is that fair,
uh i mean first of all it's important to understand like what what has tesla,
actually accomplished that is that is most noteworthy um it is not the,
creation of an electric vehicle or creating electrical vehicle prototype or,
low volume production of a of a car that they've been,
uh hundreds of cars startups over the years hundreds and uh in fact at one,
point um bloomberg counted up the number of electric vehicle startups and they i think they got to almost 500. yeah so,
the hard part is not creating a prototype or going into limited production the the the absolutely difficult thing,
which has not been accomplished by an american car company in 100 years is reaching volume production without going,
bankrupt is the actual hard thing um the last company american company to,
reach volume production without going bankrupt was chrysler in the 20s right,
and and and it nearly happened to tesla yes it but it's not like oh geez i guess,
if we just done more manual stuff things would have been fine of course not uh that is definitely not,
the case uh so we basically messed up,
almost every aspect of the model 3 production line from,
from cells to packs to driving voters motors,
body line the paint shop uh final assembly,
um everything everything was messed up um and i lived in that fa i lived in the,
fremont and and nevada factories for three years,
fixing the that production line running around like a maniac through every part of that factory,
living with the team i slept on the floor,
so that the the team who was going through a hard time could see me on the floor,
uh that they knew that i was not in some ivory tower,
whatever pain they experienced i was i had it more and some people who knew you,
well actually thought you were making a terrible mistake that you were driving yourself you were you were driving yourself to the edge of,
sanity almost and yeah and and that you were in danger of making,
bad choices and in fact i heard you say last week elon that that you because of tesla's huge value now and and you know,
the the significance of every minute that you spend that you are in danger of sort of,
obsessing over spending all this time to the point of to the edge of sanity,
um that doesn't that doesn't sound super wise isn't that like your your your time,
your your completely sane centered rested time and decision making,
is more powerful and compelling than that sort of i can barely,
hold my eyes open so surely it should be an absolute strategic priority to look after yourself,
i mean there wasn't any other way to make it work there were three years of hell,
17 8 2017 18 and 19 with three years this longest period of excruciating pain,
in my life uh there wasn't any other way and we barely,
made it and we're on the ragged edge of bankruptcy the entire time so,
so when you felt like i want pain i don't like it um,
those were three or three so so much pain but it had to be done or tesla would be,
dead when you looked around the gigafactory that we saw images of earlier,
um last week and just see where the companies come i mean do you feel that that this this challenge of,
figuring out the the new way of manufacturing um that you that,
you actually have an edge now that it's different that you've figured out how to do this and and um from,
those three years what won't be repeated you've actually figured out a new way of manufacturing,
at this point i think i know more about manufacturing than anyone currently alive on earth,
between that yeah i'll tell you i can tell you how every,
damn part part in that car is made which basically if you just live on the factory live in the factory for three,
years and that was nice that was a poignant note or something,
someone wants to compose a symphony to that uh expression of confidence uh something like that i have no idea what,
that is anyway yeah every aspect of a car six weeks to sunday i know,
i mean you you you talk about scale right now you're in the middle of writing your new master plan,
and you've said that scale is at the heart of it why does scale matter why are you,
obsessed with that what are you thinking yeah well see in order in order to accelerate the,
advent of sustainable energy uh there must be scale because we've got a transition um a vast,
economy that is currently uh overly dependent on fossil fuels to a sustainable energy economy one where the,
energy is uh yeah i mean we got to do it,
so so the energy's got to be sustainably generated with wind solar uh hydro,
geothermal i i'm a believer in nuclear as uh as well i think ever talk about,
and uh and then you you since solar and wind is intermittent you have to have stationary storage batteries and and then we're going to,
transition all transport um to to electric uh if we do those things we have a,
sustainable energy future the faster we do those things the less risk we,
the less risk we put to the environment uh so sooner is better uh and and so,
scale is very important um you know it's not about it's not about press releases it's about tonnage what,
was the tonnage of of batteries produced and obviously done in a sustainable way,
and and our estimate is that approximately 300 terawatt hours of,
battery storage is needed to transition uh transport uh electricity and and heating and cooling,
uh to a fully electric situation others may there's there may be some,
different estimates out out there but uh our estimate is 300 terawatt hours yeah,
so we dug into this a lot in the interview that we recorded last week and so people can go in and hear that more but i mean the context is that is i,
think about a thousand times the current install battery capacity i mean the scale up needed is,
breathtaking basically yeah and and and um yeah so so your vision is to commit,
tesla to try to deliver on a meaningful percentage of what is needed yeah and what and call on others to do the rest,
that this is what this is a task for humanity to massively scale up our response to change change the energy,
grade yes it it's it's like basically how fast can we can we scale um and encourage others to,
scale to get to that 300 terawatt hour installed uh base of batteries right,
and then of course uh there'll be a tremendous need to recycle those batteries which is i and it makes sense,
to recycle them because the raw materials are like high grade ore um so people shouldn't think well they'd be,
this big pile of batteries now they're going to get recycled because the even a dead battery pack is worth about a thousand dollars so,
um but but this is what's needed for a sustainable energy future so we're going to try to take the set of actions that,
accelerate the day of and bring the day of a sustainable energy future sooner,
okay there's going to be a huge interest in your master plan when you when you,
publish that um meanwhile i just i would love to understand more,
what goes on in this brain of yours because it is it is a pretty unique one i want to play with your permission this,
very funny opening from snl saturday night live can we have the volume there actually please sorry,
it's an honor to be hosting saturday night live i mean that sometimes after i say something i have,
to say i mean that [Music] so people really know that i mean,
that's because i don't always have a lot of international variation in how i speak,
which i'm told makes for great comedy i'm actually making history tonight as,
the first person with asperger's to host snl [Applause],
and i think you followed that up with at least the first person to admit it the first person to admit it,
but i mean,
so this was a great thing to say but i i would love to understand,
whether you know how you think of of asperger's like whether you can give us any sense of even you as a boy how what,
what the experience was or as you now understand with the benefit of hindsight,
can you talk about that a bit well i think i think everyone's experience is going to be somewhat,
different but i guess for me the social cues were not uh intuitive so,
i was just very bookish and i didn't understand this i guess,
others could sort of intuitively understand uh,
what watches meant by something i would just tend to take things very literally as just like the words,
as spoken word exactly what they meant but but then that didn't turn out to be wrong,
you can't they do not they're not simply saying exactly what they mean there's all sorts of other things that are meant it took me a while to figure,
that out um so i was you know bullied quite a lot,
um so i didn't i did not have a sort of happy,
childhood to be frank was quite quite rough um and um but i read a lot of books i read lots,
and lots of books and so that you know sort of gradually i sort of understood more from,
the books that i was reading and watched a lot of movies and,
you know just but it took it took me it took me a while to understand things that most,
people intuitively understand so i've wondered whether it's possible,
that that was in a strange way an incredible gift to you and and indirectly to many other people,
in as much as brains you know are plastic and they,
they they go where the action is and if in for some reason the external world,
and social cues which so many people spend so much time and energy and mental energy obsessing over if that is partly,
cut off isn't it possible that that is partly what gave you the ability to,
understand inwardly the world at a much deeper level than than most people do,
i suppose that's certainly possible um i think this may be some value also from,
a technology standpoint because i found it uh rewarding to spend all,
night programming computers um just by myself and i think most people,
most people don't enjoy typing strange symbols into a computer by themselves all night they think that's,
not fun but i thought it was i really liked it um so so i just programmed all,
night by myself and um i found that to be quite enjoyable,
um but but i think that is not uh normal [Music],
so i mean it does you know i've thought a lot about,
it's a riddle to a lot of people of of how you've done this how you've repeatedly innovated in these different,
industries and it it does you know every entrepreneur sees possibility in the future and then acts to make that real,
it it feels to me like you see possibility just more broadly than,
almost anyone and can connect with so you see scientific possibility based on,
a deep understanding of physics and knowing what the fundamental equations are what the technologies are that are based,
on that science and where they could go you see technological possibility and then really unusually you combine that,
with economic possibility of like what it actually would cost is there a system,
you can imagine where you could affordably make that thing and that that,
sometimes you then get conviction that there is an opportunity here put those pieces together and you could do,
something amazing yeah i think one aspect of whatever,
condition i had um was i was just absolutely obsessed with truth,
just obsessed with truth and and so the obsession with truth is,
why i studied physics because physics attempts to understand the,
the truth the truth of the universe physics just it's just what are the provable truths of the universe,
um and and true and truths that have predictive power um,
so for me physics was sort of a very natural thing to study nobody made me study it it was,
intrinsically interesting to understand the nature of the universe and then computer science,
or information theory also to just i understand uh logic and,
and uh you know there's an also there's an argument that you know that you the that information,
theory is actually operating at a more fundamental level more fundamental level than than even physics,
um so uh just yeah um,
the physics and information theory uh were really interesting to me so when,
you say truth i mean it's it's not like some people so it's what you're talking about is the,
truth of the universe like the fundamental truths that drive the universe it's like a deep curiosity about what this universe is why we're,
here simulation why not you know we don't have time to go into that but i mean it's you're just deeply curious,
about what this is for what this is this whole thing yes i mean i think the why the why,
of things is very important um i i actually uh when i was a i don't know,
so young teens uh i i got quite depressed about the meaning of life,
um and i was trying to sort of understand the meaning of life looking at reading religious texts and and,
reading books on philosophy and i got into the german philosophers which is definitely not wise if you're a,
young teenager i have to say can be ripped out but dark,
so [Music] much better at as an adult i um and and,
then actually i ended up reading um the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,
which is actually a book on philosophy just sort of disguised as a silly humor,
book but but actually the book it's actually a philosophy book,
and uh adams uh makes the point that it's actually the,
the question that is harder than the answer um you know this sort of makes a joke that the answer was 42. um that number,
does pop up a lot um and 420 is just 10 14 10 10 times 10,
times more significant than 42. okay you know there's um you can make a,
triangle with 42 or 42 degrees and two 69s um,
so there's no such thing as a perfect triangle or is there,
but even more important than the answer is the questions that was the whole,
theme of that book i mean is that yeah basically how you see meaning then it's the pursuit of questions yeah so i have,
a sort of you know a proposal for a world view or a motivate a motivating philosophy which,
is to understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe and the to agree,
that we expand the scope and scale of consciousness uh biological and digital,
uh we will be better able to to uh ask these these questions to frame these questions,
and to understand why we're here how we got here what what the heck is going on,
and so that that is my driving philosophy is to expand the scope and scale of consciousness that we may,
better understand the nature of the universe elon one of the things that was most,
touching last week was uh was seeing you hang out with your kids um here's if i may,
um it looks vaguely like a ventriloquist dummy there [Laughter],
i mean how do you know that's real um so that's x and and you know you're it,
was just a delight seeing seeing you hang out with him and what,
what what what's his future going to be i mean i don't mean him personally but the world he's going to,
grow up in what future do you believe he will grow up in,
well i mean a very digital future um,
a very a different world than i grew up in that's for sure um but i think we want to obviously do our,
absolute best to ensure that the future is good uh for everyone's children um and,
and that you know that the future is something that that you can look forward to and not feel sad about,
um you know you want to get up in the morning and be be excited about the future and we should fight for the,
things that make us excited about the future you know the future cannot it,
cannot just be that one miserable thing after another solving one sad problem after another there got,
to be things that get you excited like you're like you want to live,
these things are very important you should have more of it and it's not as if it's a done deal like,
it's all it's all to play for like the future may be horrible still there are scenarios where,
it is horrible but you you see a pathway to an exciting future both on earth and,
on mars and in our minds through artificial intelligence and so forth i mean in your in your heart of hearts do you really,
believe that you are helping deliver that exciting future,
for ex and for others i'm trying my hardest to do so,
i you know i love humanity and i think,
that we should fight for a good future for humanity and i think we should be optimistic about the future and fight to,
make that optimistic optimistic future happen,
[Music] i think that's that's the perfect place,
to close this thank you so much for spending time coming here and for the work that you're doing and good luck,
with finding a wise course through on twitter and everything else all right,
thank you hey guys,

Reserve University in September it is,
with great personal pleasure that I,
present to you Missouri S&T alumnus dr.,
Farouk Elbaz,
hello everyone and welcome to you all,
the when I first came to the school the,
population of the students was only,
"2,000 and among them were only three",
females so now today I have seen it's at,
the population of females is at least 40,
percent this is a wonderful spending,
thank you congratulations and they wish,
to congratulate the students and the,
parents and the families on this day,
which is really something the two that,
will be in your memory forever my or,
journey to come here started at the end,
of 1959 and one of the bureaucrats in,
Washington DC decided that I should,
arrive at RADA,
on 1 January of 1960,
I arrived by bus in night January 1,
everything in the town was plucked up,
first post the University was out it was,
mid semester and there was no one around,
and they would go walk from my hotel in,
the hill the hill of Rona every day,
single day I go down and watch was look,
at the school and win the doors of the,
school and everything is locked so I go,
to a and B buy some myself or some bread,
and slice cheese and canned fruit and,
they go visiting my room and - until the,
next day,
comes in and they keep them government,
for 15 days and the school was the heart,
of course it was locked so I was,
delighted when when drinks opened up and,
the students became there came back and,
it was really something that I I I was,
looking for and was hungry to do,
something with my wife for the classes,
and the classes name all of the single,
through all of the courses that I took,
were wonderful and they will assure you,
that you will use some of the,
information you got from every single,
course no matter what else you were I'll,
give you one example and my third year,
second year actually 1961 I took a,
course in tectonics by the chairman of,
the geology department name was Paul D,
Proctor and it was called tectonics so,
they will know about these fractures of,
the earth supposedly and then he came in,
and listed seven topics on the,
blackboard we were six graduate students,
in the course in the class and he listed,
seven topics and he said each one of you,
would select one topic and work on it,
all semester so we did and I selected,
the last one the last topic because it,
was weird it was good he wrote tectonics,
of the moon this was 1961 before anybody,
thought about the moon and we smiled and,
he told me wait until the end of the,
class and then I waited and he said why,
did you select that one I said because I,
didn't know anything about it and he,
said that's good then you have your work,
cut out for you come with me he took me,
to his office open the books and then he,
gave me and he reached in the file and,
he gave me a picture of the moon of the,
full moon and he said neither I nor,
anyone else knows anything about the,
Tecton,
the morning so take this picture study,
actually write as much as you can and,
that's all you have to do Spidy actually,
six years later I found myself,
responsible for interpreting the lunar,
orbiter pictures all the pictures of the,
moon that we had received in the last,
the two years before that which is,
1964-65 and in 1966 I was responsible,
for looking at some of these pictures,
and told the whole day I realized that,
all the kinds of things that I saw in,
that one picture that he gave me and all,
the things that I wrote about it were,
dead wrong but it wasn't it wasn't,
really the issue of whether I could get,
it right or not it was the issue of,
trying to get me to know how do you look,
at the picture and make a story out of,
it and how to interpret things that you,
see in something that is scientifically,
valid and that is what I mean about,
education and S&T and in the meantime do,
you have to think about the fact that,
the SST education here is really second,
to none be certain that your education,
here was first-rate this is all the,
graduates that we need or that chimera,
Cadi the Alumni everybody knows about,
this now from the day one when we came,
into the school week we studied all,
kinds of things and that education was,
really second to none everything every,
time I think about it I said oh my god,
they said when such as that course was,
very important for me because it's such,
a section I will tell you an example of,
the of the this validity of the courses,
that we took him on the third year I,
went to MIT because I wanted to study a,
minute,
called graphite which I found in the,
lead mines of Fredericktown Missouri so,
I went to MIT to look at the crystal,
shape of that particular mine and do,
something with it and write a paper and,
they spent the whole tier at MIT and,
while in Cambridge Mass I met the girl,
that would become my wife and we spend a,
lot of time together and they became,
very involved in the the organization of,
Arab students and I was the editor of,
the Sunday called Arab reporter and,
published so on and I was the one that,
had a war hour every week MIT radio and,
Arabic was Arabic songs and so on so I,
wasn't really looking at the the,
classrooms and the curricula because I,
had enough at the school year and,
although and behold all of the courses,
that they took at that in nearly all of,
the courses that MIT were that you could,
get an A which never really happened it,
happened at the school year so the,
meaning meaning that the education at,
MIT - as far as I'm concerned was not as,
good as the education here so be aware,
of the fact that your education that you,
get here is really second to none,
now with considerable yeah,
whatever I said I would like to leave,
you with one thought especially for the,
gladness keep in mind that the degree,
that you receive today no matter what it,
is whether it is a PSV AMS a PhD all the,
degrees that you each and every one of,
these degrees the to proceed means one,
thing and one thing only the degree,
means that until this day where you get,
a degree you needed someone to hold your,
hand and teach you from the day you hold,
that degree in your hand you can begin,
to teach yourself keep that in mind,
god bless you,
